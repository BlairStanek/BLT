Q I have a couple of questions regarding the newborn screeningprogram and the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. And I just call it -- just for purposes of our discussion here today, when I refer to the "Biobank," I'm referring, of course, to the one that's headed by Dr. Yancey, the organization with its offices and operations in Detroit at the -- at Tech Town. And then when I refer to the "newborn screening program," part of it, that's the state side, I would call it, of this particular setup. Is that agreeable that we can talk on those terms? A No. The newborn screening program is a screening program. The Michigan BioTrust is the state program that addresses the residual dried blood spots. The Michigan Neonatal Biobank is an entity that is managing the storage of those spots. Q Okay. A So I want to be -- I am very clear and precise in my language when I'm talking about the difference between newborn screening program versus the Michigan BioTrust for Health. Q Okay. So that's one of the questions I'm going to ask you about. So I'm going to jump ahead and ask you that. I'm going to set it up in a particular way, and I want you to explain to me, thereafter, what happens. A newborn is born. Blood spots are extracted. Blood samples are extracted in the form of blood spots onto a Guthrie card and are sent to the Michigan State Laboratory for testing. Once that testing is complete, I'd like you to explain to me, as best you know, what happens to those residual blood spots. A Sorry. I was having trouble with my mute. I think some of the particular detail regarding specifics around the mechanisms by which cards are handled directly after testing is best handled by Dr. Shah, the director of their laboratory. But I can share -- or I feel comfortable talking about the piece where -- that the dried blood spot card -- the newborn screen card, is -- there's a group at the laboratory that, when they are done with that card for the purposes of the newborn screening program, they process that card. The residual dried blood spots that become part of the --(Dr. Shah enters deposition) Q Doctor -- excuse me. You said "they." Who is they? A The Bureau of Laboratories at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Q Okay. Thank you. A Yup. You're welcome. And I see Dr. Shah has joined. I know this is my deposition, and he's like joining in. But he's joining in for his deposition time -- yeah, separate time; right? Q That's fine. He's entitled -- he's entitled to participate or to observe this -- the deposition as a party -- named party in the case. So, but go ahead. A Okay. Thank you. Q I apologize. I mean, I didn't mean to interrupt you. You used the pronoun, and I wanted to make sure I understood. You said, "Once 'they' were done processing the card." A Yes; yeah; yup. So when the laboratory staff are done with the card from a newborn screening perspective -- I'll let Dr. Shah get into the nitty-gritty of how that card is processed -- but the high level is that the residual dried blood spots go to -- with the exception of a spot reserved for parent/guardians, the residual dried blood spots go to the Michigan Neonatal Biobank where they are managed for the purposes of Michigan BioTrust. Q Okay. Who is responsible for overseeing the Michigan Neonatal Biobank as it applies to the Michigan -- from any individual you know at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services? A I'm sorry. Can you repeat that one more time? Q Sure. What I want to understand is is that you just said that the Michigan Neonatal Biobank stores -- and I'm paraphrasing -- stores newborn blood spots that are residual leftovers from the newborn testing program for -- on behalf of our -- under the control of the State of Michigan, I think, DHHS I think is what you said, or some variation thereof. A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q I'd like to know who at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for overseeing or otherwise controlling the blood spots at the Neonatal Biobank? A So the dried blood spots are managed by the Michigan BioTrust. That BioTrust structure has a community values advisory board, a scientific advisory board. There is also an internal infrastructure which Dr. Shah and myself are responsible for. But I think probably the simplest way to answer the question is that Dr. Shah and myself are responsible for the dried blood spots in the Michigan BioTrust program that are at the Michigan Neonatal Biobank for storage and distribution at the direction of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Q Okay. Good. Fantastic. So I guess the reason why I'm asking would be is that if a -- say in this case a judge was to issue an injunction against both of you in your official capacities, you would have the ability to direct the blood spots to no longer go to the Biobank if that's what the judge so ordered; would that be correct? A That is my understanding. Q Okay. And what -- as part of the complaint -- as part of my complaint and the research I did on this prior to bringing this complaint, I had you listed as the manager of the Michigan Bio- -- or excuse me -- Michigan BioTrust for Health; is that accurate? A So as the director of the Bureau of Epidemiology and Population Health, I am one of the two folks who is over the Michigan BioTrust for Health, the other one being Dr. Sandip Shah. Q Okay. What role does Mary Klein play in the Michigan Newborn Screening program and/or the Biobank? A So none of my -- so Mary Klein is a manager in the division of Lifecourse Epidemiology and Genomics, which is within the Bureau of Epidemiology and Population Health. So Mary Klein is in my supervisory chain. She does not -- I'm not quite certain how to answer part of your question. You asked about if she plays a role at the Michigan Neonatal Biobank? Is that what you asked me? Q Yeah. I want to understand, you mentioned that both you and Dr. Shah have supervisory control over the BioTrust. According to online disclosure forms that have been made available, that she is the manager of the newborn screening section of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. I want to know what role, if any, does she play over the newborn screening program and/or the BioTrust. And I'll add to that -- or excuse me -- the Neonatal Biobank, and I'll add to that the BioTrust if that assists you. A So Mary Klein is the director of newborn screening section that addresses follow-up of results from the newborn screening program. In terms of Michigan BioTrust, she has a role in that as we get proposals for use of dried blood spots. She has a role also in communicating -- as do other staff as well -- in communicating with the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. She does not have a role within the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. So she's in no way an employee or something like that of the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. Q Okay. I've done the deposition of Dr. Antonio Yancey. Do you know who he is? A (No verbal response) Q I'm sorry. You've got to answer "yes" or "no." A Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Sorry. I'm trying -- I have a dog in the background. Q No problem. If I say "yes" -- yes, if I make a statement like that, I'm not trying to be rude. It's just sometimes we say things like "uh-huh's" and "um's," and we just have got to get clear for the record. So I mean no disrespect by it. A Yup. Q The -- one second here. I've got my email on, and it keeps beeping incessantly. There we go, stop that. Okay. I did the deposition of Dr. Yancey, and he indicated that the blood spots were not under the control of the board of directors but actually under the control of members -- or officials with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Would you agree with that statement as I presented it to you? A Yes. The Michigan Neonatal Biobank does not have control over the use and distribution of the blood spots -- the residual dried blood spots. Q Okay. Who at the Michigan -- just to confirm -- who at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services would be the person most in charge of decision-making as to the blood spots held at the Michigan Neonatal Biobank? A The use of the blood spots under the purposes of the Michigan BioTrust program, Dr. Sandip Shah and I are responsible for the decision-making around that and that includes the use -- or the instruction to the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. Q Okay. To your knowledge, is the Michigan Neonatal Biobank holding blood samples for any other purpose other than the Michigan BioTrust program? A I do not know the answer to that question. Q Well, do you have any knowledge -- do you have additional purposes or additional blood storage for any other programs, to your knowledge? A I don't have any knowledge to what else the Michigan Neonatal Biobank -- sorry -- what else the Michigan -- what else the entity at Tech Town -- the Biobank at Tech Town, what other activities they may have going. Q Okay. Can you explain -- and, again, acknowledging that we are lawyers and the person that's going to read this transcript hopefully ultimately will be a lawyer who is a judge. We're not scientists, by any means. Can you explain, as best you can, what the role of the Michigan BioTrust is, vis-a-vis, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services? A So the Michigan BioTrust, it is a program that's run by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services in order to oversee Michigan's storage residual dried blood spots and their use in health research. Q And I believe you just -- and just to confirm, you testified earlier that that program has oversight of the Michigan Neonatal Biobank; correct? A For the purposes of the residual dried blood spots, yes. Q Okay. Is there any other program or entities that have control over the Michigan Neonatal Biobank related to blood spots that you're aware of outside of the BioTrust? A You're referring to the residual dried blood spots from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services? Is that what you're referring to? Q Any blood spots that you are aware of that are there. Is there any other entity or program that has any sort of role as it applies to the Biobank in any way, to your knowledge? A I think I shared with you earlier that I have no knowledge as to whether or not there are other forms of dried blood spots or other bio specimens that are at the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. The knowledge I have is related to the dried blood spots that are there from the Michigan BioTrust. Q Why are blood spots transferred or otherwise given to a private nonprofit corporation rather than stored under the direct control of the BioTrust program or the department of health and human services? A So the purpose of the -- the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services does not have the laboratory capacity for management of a Biobank. The amount of freezer space the software that is required to manage individual specimens over a longer of period of time is something that the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, under the Michigan BioTrust, has obtained through the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. Q Okay. Were you involved at all with the creation of the Michigan Neonatal Biobank? A No. The Michigan Neonatal Biobank, when I came in to the position -- the first position that I had related to newborn screening, when I came into that position in 2012, the Biobank was already instituted. Q Okay. And just to confirm -- forgive me. I know the answer already, but this is my chance to confirm -- is that you don't serve on the board of directors of the Biobank; correct? A No, I do not. Q Any reason why not? A I have a variety of responsibilities at the department. I also am not a laboratorian. And given Dr. Shah's and I's shared responsibilities for the Michigan BioTrust, I'm very fortunate that he was able to take on that role. Q How would you describe the nature of the relationship between Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Michigan Neonatal Biobank? And I guess let me put it in a clearer parlance than that would be is are they a contract vendor? Are they a partner? Are they another government agency? How is it, in your role as oversight of the dried blood spots that are stored in that facility, do you view the role and the relationship with the Biobank? A So the Michigan Neonatal Biobank is not a government agency. We have a contract with the Michigan Neonatal Biobank for the purposes of storage and distribution of the dried blood spots from the Michigan BioTrust. And the Michigan Neonatal Biobank has been a very good partner in terms of, you know, managing those spots, promoting the use of the spots with researchers. So I think they are -- you know, we have a contract with them. They are -- so they have a vendor relationship with us, and they've also been a very good partner in terms of moving this activity along. Q Does the Department of Health and Human Services provide monetary compensation to the Biobank for these services? A We provide partial support to the Michigan Neonatal Biobank through a contract with Wayne State University. Their Biobank can -- also has an arrangement to be able to cover some other costs related to a fee structure that is charged to researchers. But, yes, the department does provide direct contract support for the activities there at the Biobank. And I think Dr. Shah would -- sorry. Go ahead. Q No; no. That's fine. That's fine. And, again, I'm only asking what you know. I'll be asking Dr. Shah a number of questions, as well, given his role as a director on the board of directors of that particular entity when I do his deposition. A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q I'm only seeking what you know. Do you happen to know how much, as a percentage, or the dollar amount, that the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services pays ultimately that reaches -- for the operation or the services provided by the Biobank? A I'm sorry. I did not come prepared to talk about those numbers today, so I can find that out. There are times where I certainly do hear about the financial support to the Michigan Neonatal Biobank for the functions that are performing a contract but I'm not prepared to speak to those specifics or those numbers today. Q Fair enough. That's fair enough. And, again, only what -I'm only asking you what you know here today as well, so if --A Okay. Q Well, let me ask this question: I know that as part of the -- I guess -- well, let me make the representation to you that as part each newborn blood draw, the heel prick test that occurs, the hospital charges the newborns a fee for doing that, which is -- again, I don't have the dollar amount that changes year to year, but approximately $130 for that activity. Do you know if all or a portion or none of the monies from those collected fees goes to the Neonatal Biobank? A So the majority of those fees go to the Michigan Newborn Screening program. A small amount of those fees have covered some of the costs of the contract with the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. The exact percentage of that, I am not prepared to speak to today. Q Okay. I mean, can you confirm, though, it's more than zero but less than all of the money goes to --A Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's an easy statement to agree to; yes. Q Okay. Very good, very good. Okay. As part of the contractual relationship or the what- -- the nature -whatever the relationship is between the Department of Health and Human Services and the Michigan Neonatal Biobank, does someone in your role that you serve as -- and, again, I think I just called you the manager of the BioTrust and you identified your relationship with Dr. Shah as part of that oversight authority -- do you have direct control over how the Biobank stores, accesses, uses, and handles the blood spots that are submitted to it under the Michigan BioTrust program? A Can you repeat that, please? Q Sure. I guess, making it a little simpler. I just want to know if -- say for today that you -- that Dr. -- I mean, Chris over there -- Chris, the manager of the Biobanks, is doing something that you think is inappropriate for the blood spots. It's not in the best interest of the particular blood spots. Do you have the authority to call over there and tell them to change their processes and procedures? A Yes. If there was something that was inappropriate going on, absolutely. Q And I don't mean this in a legal sense. I'm talking more in either a scientific sense or a project sense. I'm not trying to be inappropriate as in legal or sexual harassment or something of that nature. I'm talking more about the blood spots, the core activities itself. You would have the ability to call or make contact with them and say, "I would like this" -- "you need to start doing it this way," and they would do it that way going forward; is that fair? A So the department has procedures that the Biobank is following. We have an understanding what their procedures are. They are in a contractual relationship with us, and we are able to, you know, I don't want to say "direct their operations." I don't mean to imply that we're sort of managing their staff in some way. But in terms of what the procedures for storage, maintenance, and distribution of the dried -- residual dried blood spots, the department is able to direct that. In this case, both Dr. Shah and myself have the ability to reach down to the Biobank regarding, you know, any issue or concern that we have. They're very approachable. Q Okay. Very good, very good. And that's what I was looking for. Thank you. So I don't know how to ask this question so bear with me. I asked a little bit earlier about the nature of the BioTrust program, vis-a-vis, the Department of Health and Human Services. And I'm trying to understand what exactly its nature is. I mean, it's -- you would agree that it's not a division of the Department of Health and Human Services; correct? A So the Michigan BioTrust program; you're asking me if it's like an organizational box or a chart? Is that what you're asking? Q I'm trying to figure out where it fits in the overall organizational scheme. I mean, it's a division; right? It's not a -- you know, the DHHS has got all its various divisions with various different responsibilities. I just -- I don't know how to describe, or how it would be best to describe where the BioTrust fits into the overall scheme of organizational hierarchy at the department itself. A Sure. Q Can you articulate that? A So we refer to the Michigan BioTrust as a program. Program can be administered between different areas within the organizational structure. So there are aspects of the Michigan BioTrust that are related to epidemiologic questions, which is my organizational structure, epidemiology, and there are aspects of the Michigan BioTrust program that are related to laboratory, which is Dr. Shah's, you know, area of responsibility. So it is a program with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services that Dr. Shah and I jointly manage. Q Okay. All right. Very good. Would you, as part of your role as the -- as part of the role involved with the BioTrust, you would agree -- would you agree with me that prior to 2010 parental consent was never obtained for medical research or at least -- or testing on blood spots for infants born before 2010? Would you agree with that? And I'm talking just on the parents. A Let me just check my -- I'm trying to take some notes here to make sure I have my dates correct. Q Sure. I believe it's April of 2010, but I know it -- I'm using at least 2010, before that. (Witness reviews electronic data via video) A I'm sorry. It's taking me a minute. Q Take your time. A So the -- it's smaller, but I can still see it, though. So the -- all right. So there are blood spots that were collected between July 1984 and May 1st, 2010 that may be used for health research under a waiver of informed consent. So we do not have active informed consent for children who were born before May 1st, 2010. Q And you indicated that you had some form of consent from something. Could you articulate what that is? A So there is a waiver of informed consent that was granted by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services institutional review board. Q Does that -- as the head of the BioTrust program, do you deem that sufficient to be -- let me strike that. As the head of the BioTrust program, do you deem that decision by the IRB to be sufficient to use blood spots for medical research and medical testing of newborn spots before 2010? A So the purpose of the waiver of informed consent is for the use of residual dried blood spots for the purposes of research, not for medical testing but for research. Q Okay. Fair enough. A So, yes, I consider that appropriate. Q Okay. Do you have -- I'm sorry. A So we have -- we have -- the institutional review board is our human subjects review board. It operates under federal regulations around human subjects, protection of human subjects. And that is the board that I rely on for those kinds of assessments, whether it be related to something like this or other research projects that may come about related to public health data or other -- well, public health data is what I work with. Q Okay. Starting in May of 2010, the department -- and this is my representation to you. I want to see if you agree with me. Starting in 2000 -- May of 2010, the department starting to obtain or attempt to obtain some form of consent from parents before utilizing newborn screening -- or excuse me -- newborn blood spots that remained after the testing was complete under the program. Were you involved at all in any way with the decision to change the policy starting May of 2010? A So I was not part of the management structure in the Michigan BioTrust at that point. I was aware, being around the department, of discussions about it, but I was not involved in the decision-making on that. Q Okay. Do you know who was the decision-maker on that policy change at that time? A I would have to go back and look at that -- for that information. I don't know. I'd have to go back and look for that. Q Would it -- okay. I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt. Would that be the person that has served in your role as the director of epidemiology at the Department of Health and Human Services? A That would be my assumption, but I would have to go back and look at that for that information. Q All right. Very good. Starting -- so from May of 2010 forward, without getting into the finer details about what actual consent was obtained, would you, in your role as the -- with supervisory control over the BioTrust, that the consent that the department obtains from parents is sufficient to conduct medical research on the newborn screenings residual blood spots? A Yes. We have created the informed consent process to allow for that -- for a parent to have active consent in the process, yes. Q Do you --A So did I answer your question? Q Yes, you did. A I'm not sure if I answered your question or a different one. Q No; no. You did; you did. And, please understand, if I'm not saying something correctly or, you know, I'm not -again, I'm a lawyer not a science person. I have good friends who are, and sometimes the words aren't quite the same. If you can correct me, I'm not above being corrected. My pride will not get in the way, so -- and besides, I'm married. I'm corrected a lot, so there you go. So the -- you just mentioned about informed consent -- just now was the phrase you just used. Do you, in your role at the department, make a distinction between consent versus informed consent? A So we -- when we are doing projects that involve consent, we use a process of informed consent. In the case of Michigan BioTrust, we invested significant time in developing the informed consent brochure for Michigan BioTrust, spent time looking at the informed consent form that goes -- that parents see, try to make those materials as clear as possible. So for the purposes of public health research, I use the term "informed consent" because that is -- the process is to inform people to what they are consenting to. Q Do you make a distinction -- setting aside this program just as a public health official, do you make a distinction between getting consent versus informed consent? A I'm not sure what getting consent means in your question. The process of what we do is about informed consent that you have provided people with information so that they can make, you know, their informed choice and that they have something to reference back to. So it's something that is common in public health and in public health research. Q Okay. You mentioned that you give information so that persons who make informed consent -- who want to give informed consent are so informed; fair? A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q I'm sorry? A Yes; yes. Q What information specifically does the BioTrust program provide to parents to give them -- to get them to the point of being informed sufficiently so that they can give their informed consent? A So the Michigan BioTrust has a brochure entitled, "After Newborn Screening: Your Baby's Blood Spots." That is -- let me pull it up. (Witness reviews electronic data via video) That is a small brochure that enables -- that provides information about what the BioTrust is, what are risks if your baby's blood spots are used for research, what steps are taken to protect privacy, that we have a certificate of confidentiality. So we have the -- there are -- there are elements of informed consent that are part of the human subject's process, and those elements are covered in that brochure. Q Do you believe as the -- in your supervisory role on behalf of the BioTrust, that the information contained in the brochure is a sufficient amount of information for a parent to make informed consent? A Yes. We work very hard to ensure that we have the elements that are needed in that brochure. So, yes, I do believe that. Q All right. Is there any other processes, procedures, or communications or documents in any way outside of the brochure that is utilized to give parents information so that they have better or equal informed consent? Essentially is there anything other than the brochure that's available to parents at the time of the birth of their child that the department provides them? A So the department engages in baby fairs. They provide education to physicians that can be used with expectant parents. We provide education to nursery staff within hospitals so that there is awareness of what this program is. The informed consent brochure, the "After Newborn Screening: Your Baby's Blood Spots," Michigan BioTrust brochure, is meant to be the document the parents can see at the time that they are signing -- that they are, you know, deciding whether or not they want to have -- whether or not they want to consent to the storage of their baby's blood spots. But there are other avenues that we use to promotethe program and the existence of the program with socialmedia, baby fairs, education to providers. Q I don't want to put words in your mouth but everything you just described would be a phrase I would usually describe as "marketing materials." Would that be a fair statement to cover what you just said? A I think it's promotion, education, marketing, you know, we have the baby's blood spot brochure up on our website. You know, with Zoom -- sorry. With the situation that we're all in right now with the epidemic, there aren't baby fairs and things like that. And we've included the brochure and other materials in virtual baby fairs that are going on. So I think, you know, we put materials out, but part of those materials are the actual informed consent brochure, which also includes the information that you would be looking at at the time that you are asked if you would like to participate in the Michigan --Q I'm going to make the representation to you that I represent five parents over -- who are the parents of nine children and all of them will testify under oath that none of them received the brochure from the Department of Health and Human Services or any agent thereof. What steps, if any, does the department take to make sure that a newborn screening -- or excuse me -- that the brochure -- I believe you call it "Your Blood Spots" I believe you called it -- the brochure is provided to parents before they're asked to sign any sort of consent form? A So the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services provides education to the nursery staff. We provide the brochure to nursery staff. The card that people are asked to sign is meant to be used in conjunction with the brochure, and that is made very clear in the education. I'm sorry. Just one second. Q No problem. Take your time. A I'm trying to enlarge something so I can read it to you. (Witness review electronic data via video) And we -- sorry. I shouldn't click and talk at the same time. I apologize. Q Take your time. That's no problem. A And the form itself that parents are signing, at the top of that form it says, "Before signing this form, please read 'Your Baby's Blood Spots'." It gives details on how small drops of blood collected for the newborn screening may be used in research through the Michigan BioTrust for Health. "If you have questions, please call the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services toll free at" phone number. Q As I understand, you're reading from the consent card itself; correct? A Correct. So we make sure to reference right at the point that parents are being asked to sign something that this brochure exists. The expectation of the department, the instruction at the department in the provider education materials is that this brochure is provided to parents, you know, so that they are ready when this card comes to them during the baby's stay at the hospital. Q Do you have any policies -- written policies, directives or laws, administrative rules or anything that directs when a brochure is supposed to be provided to parents? A In terms of the -- there is not a written statute or rule about the timing of that delivery to my knowledge. I would have to go look to see the specific language that is in the -- the education materials that we provide to staff at hospitals regarding that timing. But the purpose and the point of the training regarding active consent is -- that is important as informed consent and that parents have that brochure. Q Do you know -- when you mentioned about training, what sort of training does the department provide to the hospital that you're just referencing right there? What kind of training? Like, when does that occur and how does that occur? A Sure. So the training occur in a couple different ways. Trainings occur via webinars. Sometimes they occur where staff physically go to a hospital and have a regional inperson training. That's been difficult this year. Obviously we can't do that this year. We also offer training at different conferences that nursery staff may be at. We have a newsletter that goes out to nursery staff and other health providers talking about aspects of the newborn screening program, and we include messages about the Michigan Biotrust in that as well. Q Is training mandatory? A We are --Q That's a "yes" or "no" question. Is it mandatory? A I would need to go back and look and see if we use the word "mandatory" when we are speaking to the nurseries. It is expected that staff are trained in this. Whether or not we say this is a mandate that you must take every staff member through, I don't know if we use that word. But it is our expectation that staff who are working a nursery, you know, providing that care directly to parents, are trained about the Michigan BioTrust just as they are trained about the neonatal screening. So, you know, this is -- education about the Michigan BioTrust is being provided alongside education about the neonatal screening. Q What steps, if any, does the department take to ensure that --A I'm sorry. You may be on mute. Q No, I'm not. A No? Is it me? Q It might be you. We can hear you. A Sorry. Can you still hear me? Q We can still hear you, yes. A I can't hear you. Can you hear me? Q Yeah. A I'm sorry. I can't hear you. MR. ELLISON: Aaron, do you have her phone number or something that you can --MR. LEVIN: We can get it, yeah. That won't be an issue. (Off the record) MR. ELLISON: All right. So just for the record here, we just took a -- we had a small break because of technical difficulties, but we're back on here now. Q My question -- I'd like to follow up with the question I just asked about is there any administrative rules, policies, or directives that mandates that training be provided to the appropriate hospital personnel? Meaning everybody that needs to provide a brochure and provide the information does, in fact, do so? A Are you -- can you repeat that? I'm sorry. Q I guess let me put this into context. Okay? A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q My son was born in September of 2017 at a hospital in Saginaw, Michigan. The hospital never provided us with a brochure nor provided us with any information until almost 12 hours after his birth. At that point we had, you know, no knowledge or information about the newborn screening program, and the nurse that was there knew very little about the program as well. So the context -- that is my context. What I'm trying to understand is what steps does the department take to make sure that, for example, the nurse with my son, for example, is sufficiently and properly trained so that they can, A, provide the brochure, and, B, provide sufficient information so that parents like myself and my wife can make informed consent? Can you explain what steps or what guarantees the department provides so that the necessary training is undertaken by these hospital personnel? I think you've been calling them "nursery" employees, but the hospital personnel in some way? A Sure. So we provide regular educational sessions with personnel. When -- we also -- we do look at specifics we have about how often our informed consent form is returned blank. We look to see, you know, how often there are -there, you know, appears to be something about the form that is making clear that there's some sort of lack of clarity or some sort of -- if the form is filled out, you know, in a way that is unclear. We follow back on that as well. We have one-on-one sessions with hospitals wherewe have concerns about the percentage of forms that arecoming back blank or if we have concerns about, you know,complaints that we have received, something like that, aboutthe newborn screening program, or if there's concerns orcomplaints about Michigan BioTrust itself. We would work with the nursery coordinator andthen work to get staff refresher training. For example,we've done sessions where we will have -- you know, ourstaff will provide multiple sessions to ensure that nurserystaff has multiple opportunity within a facility to be ableto get trained. We also have repeated reminders that, youknow, there are new staff training that is available. Q Let me ask this: Do you track whether these employees are, in fact, been properly trained at an individual employee-byemployee level? A No. We do not have a record of everyone who is working in a nursery in the state of Michigan. We work with --Q Okay. Is the hospital required to keep a record like that? A Not to my knowledge, no. Q What if a hospital such as -- for example, I'm up in Saginaw. One of our big hospital systems is Covenant Healthcare in Saginaw, Michigan. What if Covenant just said, "You know what? We don't have the time because of COVID right now to deal with any of this stuff. We're not going to do anymore newborn screening blood spot extractions." Can they simply just ignore the department's directive to do so? A So in this case you're talking about the newborn screening program, not the Michigan BioTrust program? Q Well, let me be clear. I mean, just to make -- let me lay the foundation then. You would agree that the blood spots that go ultimately to the newborn -- or to the Biobank are the residual leftover spots from the newborn screening program; correct? A Correct. Q Okay. And the newborn screening program blood spots come from the blood extractions done by health professionals at the hospital within -- what? -- the first 36 hours typically of the birth of an infant in a Michigan hospital; correct? A Correct; yup. Apart from home births; correct, yeah. Q What if a hospital simply just said, "We don't want to participate anymore in your program"? What would happen? A So in the case of the Michigan Newborn Screening program, a physician who is overseeing the birth of a child must cause the newborn screening to occur. So that would be, you know, the heel stick -- there's other aspects of newborn screening besides just the heel stick that you are referring to. Q I just want to be clear. I only want to focus on the newborn screening. I know there's other tests that are done, hearing and other types of tests, but this case is only about the newborn screening program and the heel prick test. A I need to be totally clear with you. Hearing is part of the newborn screening. So what you are referring to is the portion of the newborn screening program that is the dried residual blood spots or the blood spots. So the majority of disorders that are screened for a newborn screening, occur through screening of that blood. But newborn screening also includes screening for hearing and screening for critical congenital heart defects, which are point of care screenings. So that's all part of the newborn screening program. Q Okay. Fair enough. So my --A So if someone -- so if -- yeah. Q I'm sorry. Go ahead. A So if a hospital stated, "We're too busy with COVID," I think was your example --Q Correct. A -- to be able to perform the heel stick portion of the newborn screen, we would be very concerned about that because those babies would be at risk for, you know, more than 55 conditions not being screened for that could cause significant -- could cause loss of life or significant brain damage to that child or other significant irreversible physical harm due to lack of that screen. So that would be taken extremely seriously by the department, and we would be -- I mean, I would be very surprised if a hospital took that step because of the jeopardy that it would put that child in. Q What if a parent like myself were to say, "I do not want to participate in the heel prick test at all"? "Do not take my son's blood. Do not do it for a newborn screening test. Do not put it into the neonatal Biobank, no aspect of that portion of the newborn screening program." Is that permissible? A So the -- so the state law is on the physician to cause a newborn screen to occur. If a parent was refusing to participate in that, that would be against medical advice. That would be up to the hospital to work through with that parent in that -- that parent in that case. Q So the department would not be against Michigan law, as you understand it, for a parent to direct their medical professional not to perform any aspect of that test? MR. LEVIN: I'm going to object just to the extent it calls for a legal conclusion. MR. ELLISON: Noted. Q Go ahead, Doctor. You can answer. A So the law is -- by my epidemiologic training or understanding, the law is directed at the physician, not at the parent. Q What if a physician decided, "I'm going to follow the directives of the father," which in the example we've been using would be me, and "I'm not going to conduct that test because it would be contrary to his expressed wishes and directives as the parent of that newborn child"? What steps, if anything, or what trouble could the doctor get in based on following the directive of the parent rather than the department, if any? A So state law is where the directive is coming from to the provider. I am assuming what the provider would have to do is to document all the efforts they made to explain to the parent the purpose of the screen, you know, what difficulty the child -- what risk the child is facing if they do have -- they're unfortunate enough to have one of these newborn period disorders. Yes, I think there would be a lot of education and discussion, and then the provider, you know, would have to take it up with their hospital and their legal counsel. Q So my question is what would that do from the department's standpoint? What would that do for the doctor, anything? A No. The department doesn't have some sort of sanction against the physician in that case. The department does follow up -- so what that would look like to us is that there was a child who did not receive a newborn screening. We routinely look for babies who have had a missed screen. We contact the parents to try and get the child in for a screen. These are children who -- you know, baby can appear beautiful, happy, you know, healthy, all systems go, and two days later completely crash, seize, their heart stops, they go back into the hospital because they have MCAD. Or, for example, a critical congenital heart point of care screen because some children, again, beautiful, happy, great outcome. Baby leaves, turns blue and, you know, has a major heart defect. So these programs are put in place because there are children with these rare disorders who have deaths, disability, brain damage, physical damage because they don't have the screen. So we take missed screens very seriously, and we follow up with the parents, try to explain, again, what the program is about, why it's important. We also -you know, we want to make sure that the child is connected with a pediatrician or the pediatrician is aware that the child did not have a screen. That way if the child has some kind of symptom, something going on, the physician may have a higher index of suspicion for certain kinds of conditions and be treating -be attentive to that symptom in a more urgent way than perhaps they would for a baby who has a newborn screening result that came back completely normal. Q Okay. The question for you then is part of the informed consent process and when you inform parents of their options in this system, does the department provide them -- provide notice that the parent can completely opt out or otherwise not participate at all in the newborn screening program as it applies to the heel prick test, the newborn screening program, and the Biobank as one big unit? A So this is where nomenclature and precision is very important. Q Okay. A The informed consent is for the Michigan BioTrust. Q Okay. Pretend I'm a -- again, we'll use the example of me to use it as an example. When I am presented with a copy of the brochure and the consent card, is the option of me opting out of any part of that program, meaning completely opt out of that program, is that presented as an option to me at the time that this informed consent is being -- is attempting to be obtained from a parent like myself? A Can you please be clearer in your question about what you mean by the "program"? Q I'm at the hospital. My son has just been born. I, as a parent, do not want to participate in the heel prick test, the newborn screening program, or the Biobank in any way, shape or form. In fact, I don't want you to even conduct the heel prick test because I have an objection to what you guys are doing at the Department of Health and Human Services. Is that option presented and told to me that I have the ability to opt out completely as part of the informed consent process? MR. LEVIN: I'm going to object to relevance to the extent some of this has been dismissed. MR. ELLISON: Understood. This is part of a chain, though, obviously, but I understand what you're saying. Q Go ahead, Doctor. A So the Michigan BioTrust consent brochure is presented to the parent along with the informed consent form for the Michigan BioTrust program. That is what the consent is about. Q Okay. A The consent is not about the medical care in terms of the newborn screening which, in this case, the testing is occurring at the state laboratory. So there is not active consent obtained on behalf of the State of Michigan to the hearing test, the critical congenital heart defect screen, or the heel stick. Whether or not the hospital has some sort of consent to treat form or something like that, or whether those are covered within the consent to treat form that people sign when they come in to the hospital, I don't have knowledge of that. Q Looking at the -- I believe earlier you were looking at a consent card in front of you as part of the deposition here today. A Yup. Q One of the curiosities that I find on this is that there is no option, at least as to my client's time frame when the card was in effect -- at least the version they got in effect, that would actually preclude the department from not storing the sample at all. Simply -- I guess to shortcut this that the sample should be destroyed directly after the newborn screening testing is completed. Why is that not presented as an option to parents? (Witness reviews electronic data via video) A So the card -- sorry. I'm having difficult with my screen. Q That's okay. Take your time. A So the card states -- so, for example, you can check: "No. My baby's leftover newborn screening blood spots may not be used for health research. By checking this box, you understand blood spots will be stored for up to 100 years but not used for research. The blood spots are stored so the state lab can perform quality control tests and improve newborn screening. You may contact MDHHS if you do not want blood spots stored for any reason after newborn screening." Q Do you know what year that particular version of the card has been utilized in? A If I can make it big enough. Q The reason why I say -- while you're looking, the text you just read to me is not the text that's on the BioTrust card for the infant by the initials RFK in this particular case. That would be signed by Ashley Kanuszewski on 4/22/13. Do you know when those -- I guess what I'm trying to understand, what version of the card you're looking at right now. Is there an indication? A So I am looking at the most recent card. I don't know, from what I have here in front of me, when that card went into effect, but we can find that out. Q Okay. The reason why -- I also have in front of me a copy -- and this has all been produced pursuant to a subpoena and discovery in this particular case. I'm looking at -- for the same parents, we have child CKK who was born on or about February 10th, 2016 also of Ashley Kanuszewski. That consent card is completely different than the one that was just simply three years before that. I mean, it's a whole different design completely and none of the text you just read is in that consent card. A So --Q Do you have any information as to how or why these consent cards have been changed over the years? A Sure. So as I mentioned, we work to try and improve how the language is on the card so it can be more understandable. There have also been changes in federal regulations related to informed consent that we needed to incorporate into the card so that the card changes for that reason as well. Q What federal regulations have gone into effect that require the change in the card, if you know? A So there are -- and I'm sorry. I don't have complete -- I don't have like a detailed time line to refer to here in terms of when those changes occurred and which kind of changes they were. But there have been changes to OHRP regulations as well as changes to the -- I'm going to get the name wrong -- the Federal Newborn Screening Saves Lives Authorization Act. And then again, we also -- you know, we've spent time trying to improve the language on the card to make it simpler to understand, clearer. You've referenced a couple times that I am a scientist, and of course the way I speak, you know, we try very hard to make sure that we're not using scientific terms when we can avoid it, that we're not using, you know, scientific language or that kind of thing in the card so that it is plain language because, you know, that is what makes it an informed consent as opposed to a -- just consent. Q Would you --A People need to be able to understand what you've written. Q Okay. Have you -- I'm on my downward slope here on the last few moments here. So have you, by chance, had the opportunity to read the articles written by my experts in this case, like Dr. Elizabeth Eisenhauer or Dr. Sonia Suter in this case, as part of your preparation today or previously? A I do not recall reading an article -- can you -- it was Elizabeth Eisenhauer and Susan --Q Susan -- Sonia Suter -- Professor Sonia Suter --A Oh, I'm sorry. Q -- from George Washington University and Dr. Elizabeth Eisenhauer from Oakland University. She's a professor of nursing. They've done studies about the understanding and consent by patients -- well, excuse me. I should be clear. Dr. Eisenhauer has done studies about the knowledge of parents who are providing consent at the time of birth. Have you seen her article at all? A I don't recall that I have seen her article. It has been awhile since I've read the materials that came in the original filing. Q Okay. And also -- I also was just curious if you've read the article written by Professor Sonia Suter. She's a bioethicist. She's actually a law professor writing about informed consent, about Michigan's informed consent system. Did you have a chance to read and have a comment on her article? A I do not have a comment today on her article. I do not recall reading it. It doesn't mean I haven't. It's been quite a long year in terms of COVID. Q Fair enough. And I get -- and by the way, I know you guys have been busy, busy, busy with COVID, and as a member of the public, I'm very grateful for the work you guys have been doing. So -- all right. So, finally, just a couple last follow-up questions for you. Harry Hawkins, I believe is someone who worked underneath -- correct me if I'm wrong -- worked underneath you. He's since passed obviously. Did he work underneath you as part of your supervisory chain? A No. Dr. Hawkins worked in the laboratory in a very --Q Would that be Dr. Shah? A Yes. Q Okay. All right. Can you also confirm that the information that's extracted by the newborn screening program is stored in the system that we call the "central registry"? You're looking confused. A Can you ask that again? Sorry. Yeah. Q The reason why I ask is -- so let me give a little bigger, broader context here so we can communicate effectively. My understanding is if someone like a researcher -- pretend I'm a researcher now rather than -- I've been using me as a parent. Pretend I'm a researcher at a university, and I want to get ahold of everyone, and I saw -- for example, on the video that you guys have on your website, a study was done about mercury levels for pregnant women around Lake Superior, for example. A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q And I wanted to get blood samples from everyone who is -- I want to get blood samples from the Biobank that's people from particular zip codes during a particular time frame. That information, as I understand it, is stored in the system called a "central registry." Am I right or am I wrong about that? A I'm not sure what database you're referring to. Q Okay. So the term "central registry," that's not ringing anything for you right now? A The Department of Health and Human Services has registries for -- like we have a cancer registry. There's a -- some aspects of the birth certificate are referred to as a registry at different points when the birth certificate is being managed. But I'm not quite sure what you mean in relation to newborn screening data. Q Okay. Let me ask it this way. Let's clear that off the table and ask it this way: Pretend I'm a researcher that wants to do research on mercury levels of pregnant women around Lake Superior State University -- or around Lake Superior up in the Upper Peninsula. I want to find blood samples during a particular time frame with particular zip codes up in the Upper Peninsula. How would I go about getting that information -- or how would I go about getting those blood samples that would be responsive to that categorization or that narrowing of samples that I'm looking for? How will I go about doing that? A Yup. So you would contact the department. You would provide a protocol as -- you know, with that kind of detail in it in terms of, "I need women who delivered to -- you know, were born to women who lived in these areas during these time periods." We would -- for example, Mary Klein or some of her staff might have a conversation with a researcher trying to understand more about what they are looking for so that we can help them tailor that ask. Very often researchers -- you know, you may want to know where the mother was living at the time of -- you know, before they became pregnant. We don't have information on that. So we just talk to the researcher. You know, we can identify children in terms of the zip code that they lived in that's on their birth certificate. That's the zip code that their residence was -- their mother's residence was at time of birth.So they would have their written protocol. They would also fill out a human subject review form, the IRB application. Their protocol, their IRB application would be reviewed by the human subjects review board. It would also be reviewed by the scientific advisory board that's part of the BioTrust. So there would be three reviewers with different kinds of expertise who would look at that application in a blinded manner -- pardon me. And they would provide information -- they would rate those applications. They'd provide their opinion and their score back to the department.If the application passes that point, depending on the other kinds of information that might -- that the researcher might be looking for, there may be other steps. So, for example, if you -- you may have to go through a science advisory board that vital records has. That might be another step that your application will go through. But let's pretend it didn't have to go through that one. You have gone through the human subjects review at the -- at MDHHS. You would have gone through scientific advisory board review at MDHHS. You would have gone through human subjects review at your own institution as a researcher, and at that point the information that you'd be looking for would be prepared. So there would be -- staff would go through and identify the children who we are able to pull under that request -- you know, their records and their session number. Epidemiologists would gather the data, like I'm assuming you want mother's age or, you know, how many births she's had or something -- thinking about that research question, but, you know, whatever it is that has been agreed upon. Oh, there's one other document that -- there's two other documents that you would go through. You would also have a data use agreement because you were using data for certain purposes. You can't use data -- it's not like we're just giving you data and you have ownership over it. You're getting it for certain purposes. And there would also be a material transfer agreement that covers the residual dried blood spots. Once all of those -- and the data use agreement would be reviewed by our compliance and privacy office. Once all of that paperwork, protocols, and forms have been reviewed and approved, the accession number for the children that met the inclusion criteria for that study would be sent down to Michigan Biobank -- Neonatal Biobank. That's the only thing they'd know is that accession number. They would look to find those spots. They would process however number of punches of those spots were needed.We would provide -- because there is data in this case, we would provide the limited data set with that accession number, and that would be provided to the researcher and then the blood spots would be provided to the researcher with -- sorry. Let me back up. I said something wrong there. We provide the accession number and limited data to the Biobank. They put that together with the dried blood spots for that individual and then they give it a totally different number. So the Biobank doesn't know who the child is or the mom. The researcher doesn't know who the child is or the mom. If the researcher calls my staff -- they have a study ID attached to that sample and the data that they received. If they called my staff and said, "I'm looking at sample such and such and blah, blah, blah, I want to know more about this person," I don't know who that person is.So it is -- we have -- you know, one of the reasons why the Michigan Neonatal Biobank is important is that, you know, my staff don't hold the key between the identity of this person that the materials are about and the researcher. Sorry. That was a lot of information. That was (inaudible) a long time there. Q No; no. You're saying exactly what I need. You're confirming a lot of the details that I understood and come to learn about the program. So I guess my -- I guess the point I was trying to make with all this, it is possible to associate certain identifying criteria to a particular blood sample, meaning zip code, mother's age, you know, what number you were in birth, to a particular blood sample that's being stored at the Biobank, subject to all those details that you just provided just now? A It is possible to provide a researcher with a very limited set of information about a family. And we spend a lot of time working with researchers to -- for example, we would not give mother's age. We would give age group. So we spend a lot of time limiting the amount of information or thinking through, you know, how little information -- and, quite frankly, how little information can we give to this researcher where they can still accomplish their goal and provided that goal is in, you know, alignment with the community values advisory board, the scientific advisory board, you know, all of those principles and review steps there. Q Okay. A So you wouldn't get a blood spot that says, you know, "This is from a 35-year-old mother from," you know, "2004 births at zip code such and such." You know, that would not happen. Q Let me ask this then: You mentioned now when a researcher wants to get access to a blood sample, they've got to get approval through, for lack of a better word, your office, IRB, the privacy office, the keying and re-keying of those. After all that, does the department ever go back to the parent and get their consent or back to the individual, if they're over the age of 18, and get their consent to participate in a blood study? Whether or not -- I don't want to differentiate right now, because I will in a moment, between prior -- May of 2010 and after May of 2010? A The department does not go back to parents whose child is part of a study. We're relying on informed consent or the waiver of informed consent that exists associated with that blood spot. A parent can -- or an adult whose blood spot is in our system, can put in a form to remove their informed consent to remove their samples from this process and/or to have their spots destroyed. Q I know, but my question, though, is that when studies get -when the study is -- after checking through all those offices and all those different steps, the department does not go back and ask either the parent, if the child is still a minor, or the person's blood spot itself for consent to participate in that particular study; correct? A Correct; correct. Q And before May of 2010, there was no written consent obtained by the parent for medical research for -- say for -- say, for example, a 2004 sample was to be provided from one of these studies, for example, no parental consent was obtained at that point directly; correct? A Correct. Q All right. And then the reason -- and the basis for that would have been the waiver of informed consent by the IRB board? A Correct. Q After 2010, does the department take any steps, once a child is born, they sign this consent form, does the department in any way go back after a certain amount of time and say, "Hey, your sample is subject to medical research activities. Do you wish to continue to provide us with consent?" Do you ever go back and re-up or renew consent at any point? A No, we do not. Q Any reason why not? A There's two thoughts in response to that question. We have obtained informed consent for use of a sample of materials, that is someone's, you know, intention at that time. So we make use of that informed consent going forward. We do not have a record of where that person has gone, you know, where -- where that person is now. We do not have a mechanism for reaching back out to that individual. That would be a very large undertaking to reach back to 100,000 people a year, for example, let's say. Q Okay. Let me ask this question, too, is that obviously when a child is born, they are not in a capacity to make a decision like that as a one or two-day old child. You would agree with that; fair? A Sometimes I wonder about my own daughter, but, yes, I agree. Q True, true. Okay. You would, at no point, though, when a person becomes the age of majority, which in Michigan is the age of 18, that the department doesn't go back and confirm that they -- the actual person themselves wishes to continue to be part of a potential research study or studies going forward? A Correct. We do not do that. Q Any reason why not? A We have not had resources to be able to do that. Again, the -- that would be, you know, 100,000 people a year that we are reaching back out to for re-consent, I think. Q But if you were to use a sample that the person today -- say just today -- you had a researcher today, and the person was -- the sample being used of somebody who is now 30 years old, you would not be reaching out to that 30-year-old person to say, "We want to use your sample now even though your parent, who is not you, gave some form of consent back 30 years prior on the day you were born"? You don't do anything like that; correct? A No, we do not. We do not. Q All right. Last question I have is -- all right. I guess I'm going to skip over that. I'm going to skip over that part. I want to follow up with -- we didn't start in the beginning, so we jumped right off. If you could actually give your name for the record, as we jumped right into starting into this before. If you give your name for the record? A I was wondering, yes. Q Yeah. A So my name is Dr. Sarah Lyon-Callo. I'm the director of the Bureau of Epidemiology and Population Health. Currently I am also working out of class as the director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease Prevention. I have a --Q That wouldn't have something to do with the COVID, would it? A Just a little. Dr. Shah and I are pretty much all COVID seven days a week. I have a Ph.D. and a master's degree in epidemiology. I have been working with the department officially as a civil servant since 2001. Prior to that I worked with the department as a contractor from fall of 1998. And I was the director of the Division of Lifecourse Epidemiology and Genomics with the newborn screening follow-up program beginning in 2012. I think that's everything you need from me, but happy to answer anything else. Q I think so. MR. ELLISON: At a minimum here, I appreciate your time today and working with the communications between scientist and lawyer, which is always -- not always apples to apples in communication. I appreciate your time. And on a personal note, I do appreciate all the hard work you guys have been doing down with COVID because I know you guys have been on -- very much involved. And part of the reason we've delayed these depositions as long as we have, is we want to keep you guys working on that. THE WITNESS: Yeah. MR. ELLISON: As we often thank our veterans, I'm also going to thank our scientists, so we appreciate your work helping us all out, the rest of us over here who are hiding in our holes. So we appreciate it. THE WITNESS: Well, thank you, Mr. Ellison. I really -- thank you very much for saying that. Thank you,. MR. ELLISON: Well, I was going to say nobody thanks a lawyer, I can tell you that, but I'm going to thank a scientist for sure. THE WITNESS: I have to admit I have seen -- yeah. MR. ELLISON: Anyway, thank you for your time today. I'm going to turn it back over. These two other gentleman might have some questions for you, but I'm done for today. So thank you for your time. THE WITNESS: Okay. Thank you.MR. LEVIN: Jeremy, do you have anything? Do you want to go first?MR. KENNEDY: I do have some, yes. Good afternoon, Doctor. My name is Jeremy Kennedy. I'm the attorney for the -- actually at this point Dr. Antonio Yancey.MR. ELLISON: Jeremy, I'm going to step away out of screen. I can still hear you, but I'm just going to step off the camera but keep going.MR. KENNEDY: Okay. Thank you. EXAMINATION BY MR. KENNEDY: Q Doctor, you distinguished, I think rightfully so, between the BioTrust and the Biobank; correct? A Correct. (Mr. Hendricks exited deposition) Q The Biobank, does that do anything other than store the dried blood spot cards, to your knowledge? A So the Biobank stores, maintains, you know, records about how many spots are on the stores so they sort of curate them in addition to keeping them nice and cold. And they also, upon the direction of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, distribute spots. So they'll assign the study-specific number to a spot and provide that and then distribute that spot out to the researcher at the director -- direction of Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The Michigan Neonatal Biobank will also promote the existence of this resource to researchers as well. Q They do not, however, approve research projects, to your knowledge? A No, they do not. Q And they do not select the dried blood spots that are sent to researchers; correct? A Correct. Q The only -- the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services directs them to provide certain dried blood spot cards to researchers and that is all the information they get; correct? A I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? Q When there is a -- when they are -- when they do provide dried blood spot cards to researchers, they -- the information the Biobank gets is simply, as I understand it, "Pull these particular blood spot cards and send them to this entity"; correct? A So the Biobank will be instructed to find the cards with certain accession numbers -- ascension -- accession numbers. It will be directed how any punches of the card out of a dried blood spot need to be provided -- these little 13 millimeter punches. And in some cases they may also be given a limited set of variables, information that needs to be sent with that dried blood spot. Q Okay. When they get a -- when they get a dried blood spot card from Health and Human Services for storage purposes, the card is de-identified; correct? A Correct. Q It just has an accession number that allows DHS to locate the card to say, "These are the cards we need if it comes up in the future"? A Correct. Yeah, the name, date of birth, all that is ripped off the card before it is sent down to the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. Q Okay. And the BioTrust program, can you just explain briefly what that does, the difference between the two? A So the Michigan BioTrust -- let me just make sure. (Witness reviews data via video) The Michigan BioTrust is a program that receives the use of the residual dried blood spots in health research. The BioTrust itself includes outreach community engagement activity policy development around guiding principles about what's an appropriate use of the spots. The BioTrust also has coordination and approvals of research proposals -- or disapprovals of research proposals requesting use of the dried blood spots. The Biobank is solely responsible for storage and maintenance of the spots and then distribution at the direction of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Q And, Doctor, you're familiar with the underlying policies behind the storage of the dried blood spot cards after their initial screening; would that be fair? A Yes. Q Okay. Why does the State of Michigan Department of Health and Human Services store these dried blood spot cards after they do the initial newborn screening for the disease -various diseases? A So the BioTrust for Health was put into place because there was recognition that there was this population-based set of residual sample that could be a very valuable resource for research into questions of public interest and questions for public good. So, I think, in the earlier questioning there was a comment about -- or a hypothetical about looking at mercury exposure to mothers in certain areas of the state and what sort of mercury exposure those babies may have had. It's a very important resource for understanding exposures and conditions that babies were in during one of the most sensitive periods of development in terms of gestation. Q So would it be fair to say that, generally speaking, the purposes of storing the dried blood spot cards is you are looking for ways to protect the public health? Would that be accurate, broadly speaking? A Yes, that would be accurate. Q And part of the reason you store these cards, again, in broad terms, is to at least in part develop tests for additional screenings of newborns if there are additional conditions, diseases that can be detected in the initial screening? You can discover those as well? A Yes. This resources is something that can be used to identify -- to aid in the development of new tests for new disorders. Or I should put it -- it's not a new disorder. It's disorders. Let me be clear. It's an important resource for being able to -- for researchers to be able to develop new tests that would enable the detection of severe disorders of the newborn period through the newborn screening process or other medical processes at time of birth. Q And in your opinion, Doctor, is that an important thing for the state to be able to do to develop these new tests for existing conditions? A Yes, very important. Q And why is that? A So there are more than 54 conditions that we screen for in newborn -- in the newborn screening program. The program saves children's lives. This program also prevents disease and disability in children. You know, I remember when we had the 50th anniversary for the newborn screening, being moved by meeting a young man who had galactosemia, and he -if he had not been identified as having galactosemia, he would have been, you know, considered failure to thrive. He would not be as physically robust or mentally robust as he was. And, you know, he came and spoke about what is he doing now. I've also had the fortune to work with a gentleman who was diagnosed in newborn screening with PKU, which is a disorder where his body is unable to process a particular (inaudible). What happens to people with PKU is that because they are unable to appropriately process that aminoacid, which is one of the basic building blocks of proteins in all of our bodies, they build up toxins and they lose mental capacity and other kinds of capacities. So before -- this is one of the first conditions we were able to screen for in newborn screening. And before there was a test for that and the ability for people to avoid eating this particular aminoacid, children would, again, be born healthy, beautiful, bright, you know, a wonderful moment, and then begin to deteriorate and eventually end up with significant loss of cognitive function, being unable to function, you know, independently in society.This particular gentleman who I was able to work with has now just graduated from medical school. So, you know, when I see those moments about how valuable this program has been, it certainly drives us all forward to see what else we can do to prevent disease, disability, and mortality among children. We just recently went through a -- we've added anumber of conditions just recently around lysosomal storagedisorders and a couple of other disorders, one that's calledX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. And there's frequentlymothers or families -- you know, one of the things I loveabout my job is I get to meet so many very dedicatedparents.THE WITNESS: As you are, Mr. Ellison, as well. A And, you know, this was a mother who had lost her son to X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. And we've just recently been able to begin screening for that. You know, we have lysosomal storage disorders where we have families who -you know, they've lost their first child to this disorder. And their next child, they're able to know that the child may have this disease because their earlier child, as families will say, has been sacrificed. So newborn screening enables families to know about disorders that may run in their families and prevent that, you know, loss of life -- very painful loss of life. You know, we have treatments like for sickle cell disease where children are able to take low dose antibiotic prophylaxis in their first year of life. It used to be that one-third of babies born with sickle cell disease were dead before their first birthday. And because of newborn screening, the -- you know, we don't see children dying due to sickle cell -- due to infections in sickle cell disease in their first year of life. I'm sorry. I could go on for quite for awhile. I'm very passionate about protecting children. Q No. That's a wonderful answer, and my commentary -- it sounds like it's very rewarding work. And I don't think -from what it sounded like, it sounds like you literally -this testing saves thousands of lives quite literally? A Yeah. We could calculate the number for you. I don't have that off the top of my head right now. Q That won't be necessary. A Okay. Q And there are, as I understand, a number of polices in place to protect the privacy of the individuals whose DBS cards, the dried blood spot cards, are sent to the Biobank and possibly used for research later; is that correct? A Yes. Q Are there any -- in addition to the accession number, any other policies DHS has put in place to protect the privacy of these individuals? A So the review process that we have, in terms of human subjects, in terms of scientific advisory board, the data use agreement process, are all designed to protect privacy in terms of if a researcher is going to use these dried blood spots. Is that what you're asking me --Q Yes. A -- or are you referring to something about the Biobank itself? Q No. I'm referring to any polices DHS has, not Biobank policies. A Thank you. Q And there are policies in place where a parent or a subject, you know, once they reach the age of majority, can request that the dried blood spot cards be destroyed; correct? A Correct. Q And does that request go to DHS directly? A Yes. It goes to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. There is a form. There's need for identification, you know, driver's license, birth certificate, so that we're assuring that the person who is requesting destruction has the ability to do so and that we've got the right material as well. Q Okay. And once the information is received and the request to destroy a card is confirmed by DHS, can you walk me through the -- how the cards are destroyed? What the process is to have the card destroyed? A Do you mean in terms of the -- after the approval has been done? The actual process of destruction? Q Yeah. After they get (inaudible) the request --A Okay. That --Q -- you look at everything, confirm that everything is proper, and that the card should be destroyed, what happens at that point? A So the follow-up -- the epidemiology side of the Michigan BioTrust folks who work with me usually handle the paperwork and making -- you know, making sure that everything is in there and that the request has gone up to compliance and legal for review. At the point that it is approved, we then send off to the laboratory for destruction. So I think that answer is probably better heard from Dr. Shah than me. Q Okay. To your knowledge -- and if this is something that's best asked for Dr. Shah, that's fine -- after the card is destroyed, does DHS keep any of the information that would have been contained on the card? A The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services will still retain the information on the child and what their newborn screening result was. So it is the dried blood spot card that is destroyed. MR. KENNEDY: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I have nothing further. MR. LEVIN: I have just a couple of questions for you, and then --EXAMINATION BY MR. LEVIN: Q Yeah. So we've talked a lot about -- or at the start of your deposition, talked a lot about use and control of these residual dried blood spots, but who owns these residual dried blood spots? A So the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has qualified ownership over the dried blood spots. Sorry. Let me grab my notes because I do better with my notes. (Witness reviews data via video) Yeah, so the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services is who has qualified ownership of the dried blood spots while they are in storage. The department may, you know, release part or all of residual dried blood spot to the individual and that may be -- like an individual may request their -- or their family may request their dried blood spots for use in research studies or other uses of -or destruction. So the individual retains control over that, but the department has the qualified ownership of it. The Michigan Neonatal Biobank does not have ownership over those spots, qualified or otherwise. Q So is that why a parent or an individual after they turn 18, can request destruction of those blood spots? A Yes. Q And then relatedly, can a parent or an individual after they turn 18, request the return of those residual dried blood spots? A Yes, they can. Q So we talked a lot -- or you talked a lot also about the educational materials and information provided to -- I'm going to say hospitals and medical professionals. Who is responsible ultimately for providing that information to new parents? A The medical professional treating that -- that -- the medical professional that is attending that birth I guess is the way I would put that -- treating that baby and mother. MR. LEVIN: That is all I have. Thank you. THE WITNESS: Thank you. MR. ELLISON: I've got just a couple follow-ups here, and then I think you're all done for today. And I appreciate your time. EXAMINATION BY MR. ELLISON: Q You mentioned just a minute ago about return of blood spots. Is it possible rather than getting blood spots destroyed, that you can get blood spots returned to the parents or to the person if they're over the age of 18? A Yes, they can. The -- say, for example, there has been an instance in my memory where an individual or parent -- I can't remember which -- wanted the dried blood spots used in a research study, you know, not associated with the department or the Michigan BioTrust, a separate study, and, you know, requested that the spots be sent to that -returned to the parent or adult -- I can't remember which -but went to that researcher. Q If I was a parent and wanted my child's blood spots returned to me -- just returned to me, not for another study, just I don't want you guys to hang on -- I don't want the Biobank to hang on to them anymore, would the department return those blood spots to me as their parent? A If you've gone through the process of, you know, identifying that, you know, who you are, that you are, you know, related to that spot, yes, the department can return those to you. Q Is that information ever given to a parent that they have the option to have the return of their child's blood spots, to your knowledge? A I would have to read through the brochure. I don't think it is covered in the brochure that you can have them returned to you. This is something that -- you know, the information about destruction is covered in there. At the point where people are asking about destruction, that is, people want them returned, other times people will be aware that the resource exists and (inaudible) for a different purpose and will reach out about that as well. Q Have you ever heard of a -- have you ever heard of a use of the blood spots beyond -- well, I guess let me ask it this way: Rather than doing a medical study that blood spots have been used for crime victim identification? A So that is not part of the Michigan BioTrust for Health. That is a use of the blood spots that predates Michigan BioTrust for Health. It's part of the newborn screening program. So, yes. I'm sorry. That was a long way to say "yes." Q Okay. So if a law enforcement individual wanted to get access for a blood spot for, let's say, DNA testing -right? -- the department has got some sort of process or standards in place by which they'd give that blood spot to a law enforcement officer? A Correct. There is a process -- there is a legal process that they would have to go through. It's not just that someone calls up and says that they're a policeman, they want the blood spot. There is a legal process that they would have to go through. You have to meet a standard that this is for crime victims so this -- it can be released for that purpose. Q Okay. Do you guys have any written policies or directives on this? This is something that I've not seen as existing, at least to date. I mean, is there some sort of policy somewhere or something that references this? A I do not have those things up in front of me. I did not review or prep for this kind of question right here. So, yes, but I can't describe them to you. Q You didn't prepare for this portion of the deposition? A No. Q If you would, could you get -- when you get done -- and this doesn't have to be done in the next ten minutes after we're done here. But just in the next couple of days, can you get a copy of that over to Mr. Levin? Because I'm going to request that as part of discovery request in this case. Okay? The last thing I wanted to ask is is that the -do you know, as a general custom or practice, when hospitals typically ask for consent for retention and use of medical -- the remaining medical -- or excuse me. Let me start over again. Sometimes I get tongue-tied when I'm talking here. Are you aware of the usual customary time frame of when the hospitals ask for consent from parents to use the residual blood spots for medical research? Like when is that consent sought? A Are you asking when hospitals usually obtain Michigan BioTrust consent? Q No, not Bio- --A Or are you asking --Q When the --A Because they don't have residual dried blood spots. Q Okay. Let me rephrase the question and make sure we're clear. For example, I'll just use me as the example. My son was born at 3:30 in the afternoon. The following morning at 6:00 a.m. after a whole night of no sleep and birth of a child, they presented me, an exhausted dad, and a sleeping mother, with a consent card for signature. Is it the usual practice of hospitals, based on your knowledge, that hospitals ask for consent after the birth of the child but before they discharge from the hospital? A So I'm not sure what consent you would be talking about in terms of the hospital practice. Q Well, let me -- the consent card that's in front of you that checked the box "yes" or "no." The one that we've been talking about. A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q That was presented to me after 12 hours of no -- more than 12 hours of no sleep and my wife -- after my wife just gave birth to our son; right? And this is my representation. Obviously you weren't there. I acknowledge that. As well as I will also represent that to my clients, each one of them were at different hospitals, were presented with their cards almost about 12 hours following the birth of their child. Do you know if that's the usual customary practice or the standard practice required by the department when seeking consent for putting these blood spots -- or deciding what to do with these blood spots for medical research purposes?(Mr. Hendricks joins deposition) (Ms. Campbell leaves deposition) A Okay. So now I understand what your question is is you're asking about what a usual practice -- am I aware if there's a usual training of the presentation of the informed consent brochure and presentation of the card. Okay. So I wasn't sure if you were talking about like some sort of residual tissues or something that the hospital deals with in a different way. But I'm hearing that you're asking about Michigan BioTrust. So the neonatal blood sample, there is a period of time after the baby is born. There is sort of a window after the baby is born that it's important to draw that sample. And, you know, if you draw the sample too early -so a lot of what is being detected for in newborn screening are different metabolites that the baby has generated in their blood and they have to find this window of time where there's enough time that the baby will have generated those metabolites that can be screened for but not too much time that the information is no longer useful in terms of being able to identify newborn screening disorders in a timely manner to protect that child. So that's why this 12 hours. So 12 to 24 hours isthe period of time that you want to have that blood drawnfor that baby. Length of stay for a healthy -- a lucky,healthy baby in the hospital is around 24 to 48 hours, sothere's a lot that is being managed and packed in in termsof that child's care during that time. So 12 to 24 hours iswhen they want that sample drawn. In terms of -- you know, I am not a neonatalnurse, but in terms of how they're functioning, they'regoing to want to handle everything about that newbornscreening card, including the Michigan BioTrust consent,which is in the newborn screening card, even though it's notpart of the newborn screening program, and they're going towant to, you know, manage all of that information, thoseasks, at the same time. Q Well, let me ask you --A So I think it's not surprising to me that it's around that 12-hour time for the parents that you know. Q But let me ask this, though. If a parent -- if you truly wanted a parent to understand the risks and benefits of this program, meaning whether it's -- and I would actually say both, but we're here specifically about the neonatal Biobank storage and use of medical researchable blood, wouldn't it make sense to require that hospitals need to give these two or three weeks out before the parents show up at the birth rather than in the aftermath of right after the birth occurred? A So about one-third of the births in the state are not preregistered at hospitals prior to delivery. That said, we encourage hospitals to provide information in baby packets. We work with OB/GYN's and other groups to promote awareness of, like, what to expect. So we promote the information about newborn screening but also about the Michigan BioTrust to health care providers so that they can provide that to patients. Q But there's no rule requiring that, though; correct? A No. MR. ELLISON: Thank you very much. Again, appreciate your time today. MR. LEVIN: I have just one follow-up briefly. EXAMINATION BY MR. LEVINE: Q So if somebody submits a consent form -- strike that. I'm going to rephrase. If a parent signs a form providing informed consent to the BioTrust program in storage and research and medical projects, can they change their mind later? A Yes.
