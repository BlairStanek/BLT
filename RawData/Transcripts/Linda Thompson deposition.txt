Yes. Q. Do you remember what those documents were? A. Yes. Policies, notes from the case. Q. Okay. And during the plaintiff's employment with the defendant, was she ever promoted? A. Her position was changed from title clerk to office manager.Q. Okay. Was that considered a promotion? A. I believe so. Q. And was there an increase in pay when she -when she changed positions? A. I don't know. Q. Okay. And are you familiar with the name Robert Prohias? A. Yes. Q. Was he an employee with the defendant? A. Yes. Q. And what was his position with the defendant? A. He's a general manager for the Homestead store. Q. Okay.

And are you aware of a complaint made by the plaintiff against Robert Prohias in September of 2020? A. Yes. Q. Who in the defendant's organization was responsible for receiving complaints of discrimination or harassment in the workplace during the period of the plaintiff's employment with the defendant?A. Myself, Anthony Giardini, Allen Spitzer, and Andrew Spitzer. Q. And who in the defendant's organization was responsible for investigating complaints of discrimination or harassment in the workplace during the period of the plaintiff's employment with the defendant? A. I am. Q. And you were the only person that was tasked with investigating complaints of discrimination and harassment in the workplace? A. Yes. Q. Okay. When were you first informed of the complaint that the plaintiff made against Robert Prohias in September of 2020? A. 9/23 of '20.Q. And who told you about the complaint? A. I received a call from Katrina Modin, and then I spoke with Lourdes directly. Q. Okay. And what did Katrina Modin tell you? A. She said she received a call from Lourdes and I needed to speak with her. Q. And did you communicate with the plaintiff about the complaint against Robert Prohias in September of 2020?A. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? Q. Yes. Did you communicate with the plaintiff about her complaint against Robert Prohias in September of 2020? A. Yes. Q. And did you take any notes during that conversation? A. Yes, I did. MR. WOODSIDE: Okay. I'm going to offer as Exhibit 1 some handwritten notes. And I will share my screen for that.(Exhibit 1, Handwritten notes of the deponent, was marked for identification.) BY MR. WOODSIDE:Q. Okay. Ms. Thompson, are you able to see these notes here? A. Yes. Q. Are these your handwritten notes? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And I'm going to scroll through these. It's a few pages. I just want to confirm that these are all your handwritten notes here, if that's okay. A. Okay. Q. And let me know if you need me to slow down or go back to anything. Okay. So are these the only handwritten notes that you took for your call with the plaintiff on September 23, 2020?A. So those notes are a compilation of several different dates. That is not the notes I took. Only a partial piece of that is from 9/23. Q. Okay. And so which parts? And I'll scroll through wherever you want me to scroll through here. A. So go to page 3. Scroll down. Q. Let's see if I can zoom out a little bit here. A. Okay. Stop. Go down one more page. Go down one more page. That's a different day. Q. Okay. So which pages do you believe are from your telephone conversation with the plaintiff on September 23, 2020? A. 1 through 5.Q. Okay. And then so during this conversation with the plaintiff on September 23, 2020, did she make a complaint that Robert Prohias bit her tit and grabbed her ass? A. Yes. Q. Does the plaintiff also make a complaint that Robert Prohias refers to employees as Sista, S-I-S-T-A, and Negrita, N-E-G-R-I-T-A?A. She told me that someone else told her that. That is not direct -- Lourdes didn't hear that specifically. Q. Okay. And then did the plaintiff make a complaint that Robert Prohias had asked her on dates and to a couples massage? A. Yes. On 9/23. Q. And then did the plaintiff state that she rejected those offers of a date and a couples massage? A. Yes. She told me that he had asked for that prior to 9/22, which I never knew about until 9/23. Q. And did the plaintiff state that other employees of the defendants had left their employment with the defendants because of Robert Prohias? A. She did. And people did leave because he was holding them accountable. Q. Okay. And so were the complaints regarding other employees leaving because of Robert Prohias, were those ever investigated? A. I spoke to people about their disagreements with Robert, and it came down to a work site disagreement, it had nothing at all to do with any harassing or discrimination. Basically, he gave them a process and he expected them to follow the process, and when they didn't, he would -- he would reprimand them. They didn't like it.Q. Okay. And did the plaintiff make a complaint regarding Robert Prohias' spying on another employee, female employee in a restroom? A. He -- she did mention that Robert would take notice of how many times Barbara would use the bathroom. Q. And was that ever investigated? A. Yes. I asked people. She just was always away from her desk, so they were, like, Why is she always in the bathroom? Q. And did the plaintiff make a complaint regarding Robert Prohias threatening to punch a co-worker? A. She stated that, yes. That was never verified. Q. Was any investigation done? A. I spoke to Robert about it. And I asked him if he lost his temper with the employee, and he stated he did, but he did not threaten to punch anyone. Q. And did you ever interview the co-worker that allegedly Robert threatened to punch? A. He was no longer employed, so I didn't -- I didn't speak with him. Q. And did the plaintiff make a complaint regarding Robert Prohias stating that he would not hire black people?A. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? Q. Of course. Did the plaintiff make a complaint regarding Robert Prohias stating that he would not hire black people? A. Lourdes made that statement. In our -- in our records, though, as far as who was getting hired, it was very diverse. Q. And was Robert ever interviewed regarding that allegation? A. No. Q. And then so why were you specifically asked to speak with the plaintiff? A. Why was I asked to speak to her? Q. Correct. A. Because she said that she was bit by Robert. She was claiming sexual harassment. Q. Yeah. I guess I'm just asking, you had stated previously that she had contacted a Katrina Modin, and then you were asked to give her a call; is that correct? A. Katrina Modin is in the HR department, and she reports to me, so those matters would roll up to me. Q. Okay. And then so what is the defendant's policy or procedure on who interviews employees who are alleging discrimination or harassment by other employees?A. The policy states that the report should be made to Allen, Andrew, myself, or Anthony Giardini. As far as who can talk to them, that is not lined out in our policy. Q. And have you had communication with the plaintiff to determine what, if any, remedial actions she wanted the defendant to take regarding her complaint? A. I did. I had several phone calls with Lourdes after 9/23, coaching calls, checking-in calls. On 10/13, I spoke with her checking in with her and following up on some other stuff, and I asked her, "So Lourdes, what is it you want? What will -- you know, bring this to -- to the place where you want it to come to?" And she stated, "I want Robert to apologize in front of Pablo for speaking inappropriately to me." And I said, "Okay. You want him to apologize to you then?" And she says, "Yes." She never at once -- that was the only thing she wanted. I was shocked by that, considering if somebody had bitten me I certainly wouldn't just want them to apologize for how they spoke to me. But that's exactly what she said. Q. And that was a telephone conversation? A. That was a telephone conversation witnessed by Kelly Logan, my teammate. Q. Okay. And does the defendant have a policy whereby the employee filing a complaint can offer a suggested solution to the complaint? A. Well, we try to, you know, work together to come up with, you know, the best solution for everybody involved. You know, sometimes people just want an apology, sometimes it's more severe. It just depends on the situation. Q. And did you ever communicate with Robert Prohias regarding the complaints made against him by the plaintiff? A. I did. Q. And when did you speak with him? A. I didn't put a date on those notes. It was after the conversation that Andrew had with him. Q. And did anybody interview Robert Prohias as a part of the supposed investigation? A. Yes. Andrew did. Q. And Andrew, you are referring to who? A. Andrew Spitzer. Q. And to your knowledge, as of September 24, 2020, did Andrew Spitzer have any training in interviewing employees who were alleged to have discriminated against or harassed other employees?A. I don't know. Q. And did Robert Prohias receive any disciplinary action as a result of the complaints made by the plaintiff? A. Yes. He had to undergo additional training. You know, he was coached. We had a document for that. And he was given some time off. Q. You said there was a document for that. What are you referring to? A. The e-mail recap that Andrew did. Q. Is there any documentation evidencing Robert Prohias agreed to do anything that you just stated? A. I believe in the e-mail. I don't know for sure. Q. The e-mail -- I'm sorry. What e-mail are you referring to? A. The recap e-mail by Andrew Spitzer. Q. Okay. So Andrew Spitzer sent you an e-mail recapping the conversation, correct? A. Yes. I gave Andrew the information and what to say and do with Robert. After the conversation Andrew had with Robert following those guidelines, Andrew sent an e-mail recapping that conversation. Q. I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? A. And giving Robert's answers to the conversation. Q. And so other than the e-mail that Andrew Spitzer sent you, is there any other documentation or any documentation from Robert Prohias himself? A. Not to my knowledge. Q. Okay. Did the Homestead dealership have cameras in the office during the plaintiff's employment? A. After the allegation, but not prior. Q. Okay. And so after the allegation were cameras installed by the defendant? A. Yes. Q. And so whose idea was it to put cameras in the office where the plaintiff worked? A. Mine. Q. And who had access to view those cameras during the plaintiff's employment? A. I don't know. Specifically, I think lots of people could view them. Q. Would Robert Prohias have access to view those cameras? A. Yes. Q. And is the footage that those cameras reported, is it saved anywhere? Is it just a live stream?A. I don't know. Q. Okay. I'm going to stop sharing Exhibit 1. After September 2020, or after September 23, 2020, are you aware of any other complaints that the plaintiff made against Robert Prohias during her employment?A. No. Q. Okay. I'm going to offer as Exhibit 2 an e-mail. Just give me one second. (Exhibit 2, E-mail of 10/1/2020 from Kelly Logan to Linda Thompson, was marked for identification.) BY MR. WOODSIDE:Q. Can you see this e-mail, Ms. Thompson? A. Yes. Q. And this shows an e-mail -A. Oh, yes. Q. -- correspondence from a Kelly Logan to you; is that correct? A. Correct. Q. And when is this e-mail dated? A. October 1st. Q. Of 2020? A. Correct. Q. And what is this e-mail? What does it state? A. Do you want me to read it? Q. You can if you want. A. "Lourdes called the main management number for you, but you were on a call. Payten then gave the call to me. Lourdes from Homestead said she doesn't feel safe, called the location a hostile environment, and said that she is leaving for the day. She said she is going to count cash, lock everything up, and then leave. Lourdes said she would like to go back to work tomorrow afternoon to do her job. She said she would -- wants absolutely no contact with Robert, no speaking, no e-mails, and she doesn't want to see him or be in his presence. Lourdes also stated that she feels that this should have been handled much better. She didn't go into detail about what would have been much better, but she did say that she spoke with you about this issue last week." All right.Q. So previously you had testified that after the complaint in September of 2020, that you had spoken with her and that all she wanted was an apology from Mr. Prohias; was that correct? A. Yes, on 10/13. Q. Okay. And does this e-mail ask for anything other than an apology?A. It says she doesn't want any access to Robert. However, that is not possible in this work situation. Q. Okay. And so she had asked to have no contact with Robert Prohias, correct? A. Correct. Q. No speaking with Robert Prohias? A. Yes. Q. No e-mails with Robert Prohias? A. Yes. Q. She does not want to see him or be in his presence; is that correct? A. It is correct, but it is implausible in this work environment. Q. Okay. And she also stated that she does not feel safe and that it's a hostile environment. Is that correct? A. She does state that. Q. And did you ever speak with the plaintiff regarding this e-mail? A. I probably did. I spoke with Lourdes many, many times about many, many things. Q. Okay. A. She complained about several different things. About, you know, if somebody came into the office with somebody else, she complained. She complained that she thought people were recording her. She complained almost daily about something.Q. Okay. And so specifically for this e-mail stating that she does not feel safe, is there any documentation to show any conversation or any investigation? A. We instituted a buddy system so that she wouldn't be alone with anyone. We also installed the cameras to make her feel safe so that she wouldn't be alone and she wouldn't be in a condition where somebody could hurt her. Q. Okay. That wasn't my question. My question is, is there any documentation to show that anybody investigated the complaint that's contained in this e-mail? A. I don't believe so. Q. Okay. I'm going to stop sharing Exhibit 2. And then are you aware of any other complaints that the plaintiff made against Robert Prohias, other than the e-mail that I have just shown you or the complaint in September of 2020?MS. LAZO: Objection, form. BY MR. WOODSIDE:Q. Are you aware of any other complaint that the plaintiff made against Robert Prohias? MS. LAZO: Go ahead, Linda. THE WITNESS: I'm just trying to recall. She complained about everything. She complained about getting a car. She complained about not getting a car. She complained about being alone and not being alone. So -MR. WOODSIDE: Okay. I'm going to offer as Exhibit 3 another e-mail. Give me one second. (Exhibit 3, E-mail of 10/14/2020 from Lionda Thompson to Lourdes Gonzalez, was marked for identification.) BY MR. WOODSIDE:Q. Have you seen this e-mail before, Ms. Thompson? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And this e-mail was sent October 14th, 2020; is that correct? A. Yes. Q. And in this e-mail the plaintiff states that she does not feel comfortable having Robert Prohias around her; is that correct? A. Yes. Q. And so what was your response to this e-mail? A. I basically told her that it wasn't possible to keep them separated if they're both working in the same dealership. I mean, you can read it right there. It's not possible. He was the general manager of the store, and if she's the officer manager, they have to communicate for business purposes. It's just not possible to not be communicated with or be near anyone. We can't do business.Q. Okay. I'm going to stop sharing that one. Are you aware that the plaintiff filed a police report against Robert Prohias for battery on the date of October 3rd, 2020?A. I am. Q. And how did you become aware of that? A. I don't recall. Q. And did the police ever contact you regarding that police report? A. No. Q. Are you aware if the police contacted any employee of the defendant regarding that police report? A. I am not. Q. Does the defendant have a policy regarding disciplinary action for employees who are involved in criminal activity? A. Could you repeat that question? Q. Of course. Does the defendant have a policy regarding employees who are involved in criminal activity?A. We have policies that touch on it but not specifically a policy for that. Q. And so if an employee was found to be involved in criminal activity while employed by the company, would there be disciplinary action taken against that employee? A. It all depends on the situation. Q. And since you have been HR director, how many complaints of discrimination or harassment in the work place have you investigated? A. I'm not sure. Q. And what training do you have to investigate complaints of discrimination or harassment in the workplace? A. I have had senior HR directors train me. I have gone to seminars. I have done workshops. I have spoken with several lawyers. Q. And other than the plaintiff, were there any complaints of discrimination or harassment made by employees of the defendant against Robert Prohias? A. No. Q. Was the plaintiff ever disciplined during her employment with the defendant prior to making the September 23, 2020, complaint against Robert Prohias?A. No. Q. Was the plaintiff ever disciplined after September 23, 2020, during her employment with the defendant? A. We were going to, but she was out of the office, so we were unable to have that conversation with her. Q. Okay. So is there any documentation to show, you know, any type of disciplinary action prior to her termination? A. There is a document that was prepared but not signed off on because we didn't have the conversation with her. We were unable to. Q. Okay. And so when was that document prepared? A. The 3rd of November, 2020. Q. And that was the day before she was terminated? A. That was two days before she was terminated. Q. Okay. Are you generally familiar with the progressive disciplinary system? A. Yes, I am. Q. Does the plaintiff have a policy regarding progressive disciplinary systems? A. We do. However, if the situation is severe, we are not written in stone to do that progressive. It is within our rights to terminate due to severity of a condition.Q. Okay. And so was that system, progressive disciplinary system utilized by the defendant in regards to the plaintiff? A. Yes. We were prepared to write her up for her conduct as a formal written warning. In those specific days on November 3rd and 4th, we became very aware of some very severe issues regarding cash deposits and several titles that had not been processed appropriately, which would have led to financial hardship for our customers and the dealership. Q. Okay. So prior to the plaintiff's termination, was she given any type of formalized document regarding any discipline? A. No formal document. On October 9th, she was spoken with, with Tammy Lowe as far as trying to be accountable to the titles that were late, and they were telling her that she needed to get those flipped. And so they were coaching her on that. Q. Okay. Are you familiar with a performance improvement plan? A. I am. Q. Does the defendant utilize any type of performance improvement plans?A. We do if the situation calls for it. Q. And so did the plaintiff receive any type of performance improvement plan? A. No. Due to the severity of the situation, we didn't feel that was an appropriate act to take. Q. Okay. And did the plaintiff have access to a company car in order to drive to the bank to make deposits during her employment? A. She did. Q. And was that access taken away? A. I'm not aware of that. She also had a $400 car allowance. So she was given that so that she could drive her own car and it would cover the expenses. Q. Okay. That wasn't my question. My question was, did she have access to a company car that was taken away during her employment? MS. LAZO: Asked and answered.MR. WOODSIDE: Counsel, can you instruct yourclient to answer the question?MS. LAZO: Go ahead. Say it again.THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of that. BY MR. WOODSIDE:Q. Who in the defendant's organization was responsible for handling requests for accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act for the period of time that the plaintiff was employed by the defendant?A. That would be HR. Q. And would you specifically receive those requests, or was it somebody else? A. Either myself or one of my members of my team. Q. And did the plaintiff ever make any request for an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act? A. No. MR. WOODSIDE: Okay. I'm going to offer as Exhibit 4 some doctors' notes. And I'll share my screen.(Exhibit 4, Campbell Urgent Care office note of 11/2/2020, was marked for identification.) BY MR. WOODSIDE:Q. Okay. I'm going to go through a few of these pages here and see if you have ever seen these documents. Have you ever seen this first page here, Work Related Activities and Limitations?A. Yes. Q. Okay. And so is this considered a request for an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act? MS. LAZO: Objection. Talking about the applicability of the ADA. THE WITNESS: I did not deem it as under the ADA. It's not -- it's a temporary week. It's healed. It's -- yeah. No. BY MR. WOODSIDE:Q. Okay. And so what training have you received in relation to determining accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act? A. I have reviewed the policies on numerous occasions and then been in seminars about it. Q. Okay. And so this request was rejected; is that correct? A. No, it was not rejected. Q. So you granted the accommodation? A. Yeah. MS. LAZO: Objection. THE WITNESS: If she had to be off, she had to be off. It was a doctor's note. BY MR. WOODSIDE:Q. Okay. I'm going to scroll through a couple more pages to see if you have ever seen these pages before. Have you ever seen these pages before? A. Yes. Q. Have you ever seen these pages before? A. Yes. Q. Have you ever seen this page before? A. Yes. Q. And so who would have communicated with the plaintiff that this request was granted? A. I don't -- I don't think anyone would have called her to say it's granted. Q. So how would she know if it's, you know, granted or not? A. She basically was telling the employer, "I'm out." At that point we weren't going to tell her, "No, you have to come in." Q. So to take a step back for a second, I'm going to show you the first page of this exhibit. And it is dated, the visit date is 11/2/2020. And this request asks for light duty for one week. Patient should not lift. Limitations are designed to promote healing. Do you see where I'm talking about?A. Yes. Q. And so this request for light duty for one week and patient should not lift, did anybody, you know, tell her that's okay or that's not okay? A. No. Lifting really wasn't a part of her job. Q. Okay. I'm going to stop sharing this one. (Exhibit 5, Southernmost Foot & Ankle Specialists office note 11/4/2020, was marked for identification.) BY MR. WOODSIDE:Q. Are you able to see this document? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And this document is dated as seen in the doctor's office 11/4/2020. And it states, "Unable to return to work." Have you ever seen this document before?A. Yes. Q. And then the second page, again, is a visit date of 11/4/2020. Have you ever seen this document before? A. Yes. Q. And so this document states that the plaintiff is unable to return to work. Did the plaintiff make any request for any time off as a result of that?A. I don't know if she spoke to somebody in the store. She didn't speak to me. (The reporter requested a pause to adjust equipment.) (A recess from 10:40 a.m. to 10:48 a.m.) BY MR. WOODSIDE: Q. Okay. So, Ms. Thompson, what was the defendant's response to this request that's contained in this doctor's note? A. We didn't give her a response. Q. Because she was terminated? A. Essentially, yes. MR. WOODSIDE: I don't have any further questions. And I'll stop the screen share. MS. LAZO: I'll have some follow-up questions. CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. LAZO:Q. Are there any kind of trainings in sexual harassment and discrimination that new employees get? A. They do. There's a sexual harassment training video and a quiz that every new hire takes. Q. And do you have a written policy regarding how to report sexual harassment? A. We do. Q. Are employees given that, a copy of that? A. Yes, they are. Q. And did Lourdes receive one of those? A. Yes. Q. After her initial complaint, how many times would you say you followed up with her, had phone conversations with her? A. I don't have an exact number but several, we spoke almost daily. Q. Okay. Afterwards, beside saying that she didn't want to see Robert, did she ever complain that he had harassed her further after the 23rd? A. No. Q. Did she ever say that he grabbed her or asked her out? A. No. Q. Before the 23rd, had she made any complaints about Robert? A. No. Q. Had anyone else made any complaints? A. No. Q. When Robert was hired, would he have had a criminal background check? A. Yes. Q. On the November 3rd write-up, what was the problem that she was, I guess, going to be disciplined for? A. Her conduct, her verbal conduct. She was speaking inappropriately. Q. And how did you know about that? How did this come to your attention? A. I had several employees call me or contact me through Robert via e-mail, and verbally, reporting times where she would call people names or just speak in a manner that was referred to as snarky or just difficult to get along with.Q. Were you part of the decision to terminate her employment? A. Yes. Q. What was the ultimate reason for that? A. For her performance and conduct. We discovered on or about 10/29 of '20 several titles ranging from different wholesalers and whatnot that had not been turned over as they should have, so that they were out of the 30-day scope, by law, that we have to follow. We found cash deposits that were not done. Several -- several breaches in that regard. So that severity along with her conduct issues were the reasons we decided to terminate her. Q. Are those kind of problems the kind of thing that would get you fired without the progressive discipline? A. Yes. They were severe. It was high dollars were at stake. Q. After Lourdes made her complaint, did you talk to anyone else in the store as part of your investigation? A. I did. I spoke with Tammy Lowe who was present during this time. I also spoke with Kelley Harrington, who was the F&I director, who was down there from Ohio and had specifically spoken with Lourdes and been around the store and Robert. Q. All right. So these are people that would have been in the store and seen the interactions? A. Yes. Q. And what did they tell you? A. They told me that they had seen nothing of this kind of behavior; that he was a gentleman. They didn't see -- no issues. Q.
