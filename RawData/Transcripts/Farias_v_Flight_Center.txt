Do you know what the course was called? A. I just remember the first course I did was just like main safety, main safety. Q. That was what the course was called? A. No, the course wasn't called that. OSHA, I don't really remember because it was like almost five years ago. Q. That's okay. Do you remember the sum and substance of that course, like generally what it was? A. Excuse me? Q. General speaking, if you were to give me like a general overview in a few sentences, what was that course about? A. Well, what I would say it talk about it's safe to be aware where you're stepping and where you're walking.

I had them with me, but I wasn't wearing them. Q. Okay. Were you supposed to be wearing them? A. OSHA says you use glasses when you're cutting something, welding something or doing something that could harm your eyes. So we was unloading, so I think it wasn't necessary to wear the glasses at that time. Q. Did TWA ever provide you with any of these gloves or safety glasses or helmets or boots? A. No. Q.

Did you have an attorney that represented you for the workers' comp claim? A. Yes. Q. Again, I don't want to know about anything that you said to him or her, who was the attorney? A. The name? Q. Yes, just the name? A. Davis. Q. Is he part of a firm? MR. GROSSMAN: The Klein Law Group. The attorney's name is David Klein, the Klein Law Group. MS. FILLMORE: Counsel, I'm just going to request the non-privileged portions of that file. Q. Were you referred to that attorney by anyone? A. No. Q. How did you find him? A. I was doing my own search and I found him myself. Q. Okay. What was the first work-related thing that you did on the date of the accident? A. The first thing I did. Actually they told me outside and start working, putting together awning the first day I started work. Q. Let's do it this way. How did you get there? Did you go to the warehouse first and then to the site or just go straight to the site? A. No, warehouse first always. Q. Okay. Then who took you to the site? A. The driver, the mechanic. Q. The one that you can't remember? A. Yeah, him. I don't remember, I don't know why. Q. If it comes back to you let me know, but we'll just call him the guy that you can't remember? A. Fine. Q. Okay. When you got there when you got out of the car, what did you do? A. I start taking out the tools that we was going to use. Q. What tools were those? A. You're talking a regular day? Q. That day? A. For TWA? Q. Yeah, that day? A. We didn't take no tools out. What we did, we got out of the truck and I start taking out the straps that's holding the panels to the other side of the truck, we were loosening the belts. Q. Okay. After you loosened the belts, what did you do? A. We start unloading the first things that were at the top of the truck. Q. That was all of you? A. The four of us in my group, yes. The other ones were trying to figure out, I don't know, on the rooftop they were doing their own thing. I was just focused what I was doing in the floor, in the main. Q. Who was with you? A. Felipe, Fidel, myself and the other mechanic that I don't remember his name and the guy that was riding the fork. Q. Who was that? A. That's the guy they called to rent for the day the machine. I don't know. Q. Okay. Do you know rented that lift machine? A. All I know, it was Five Star. Q. Okay. Where was John Junior? A. When? Q. Where? A. Yes, but specific. Q. Sorry, you're asking me when. I mean where was he when you began to unload the materials? A. In the rooftop in The TWA Hotel. Q. How high is The TWA Hotel? A. It's really high. Like I can't give an estimate, but it's really high. For them to use a long crane lift it's because it's high. Q. How long between when you arrived at the site and when you started loosening the belts on the materials went by? A. Maybe like 40 minutes. Q. So from when you got out of the car? A. No, less than that. No more than ten minutes. Q. What did you do between when you got out of the car and when you started loosening the belts? A. After that what I went to do? Q. Yeah, between the ten minutes that it took you get out of the car and loosen the belts, what did you do? A. I was just loosening the belts. I don't understand your question. Q. How much time passed between when you like literally stepped your first foot out of the vehicle and when you started loosening the belts? A. It took me doing that loosening the belts and all that, ten minutes. Q. No. What I'm asking is, when you stepped out of the vehicle and then when you started loosening the belts, so like the second you started loosening the belts, how much time passed? A. As soon as I got out of the truck I didn't loosen the belt. First I went because I'm the one who speaks because the truck was in the way. So we couldn't do anything before the truck moves out of the way, so that's what I was doing. Q. Okay. A. Trying to figure out who was the owner of the truck and make the guy move the truck. Q. Did you speak to that guy? A. I didn't get to find the guy. Actually that's when the manager, the guy from TWA came. Q. And what happened at that point? A. And after that I stepped back, went back to my truck and that's when I told you I wasn't listening, I don't know what they were talking about. Q. Okay. A. We had to wait like 20 minutes for the truck to move. Q. When the truck finally moved you were able to start loosening belts; right? A. Then we start the loosening the belts, exactly. Q. Okay. Was John Junior ever made aware that you guys couldn't start working because the truck was in the way? A. Yes. Q. When was that? A. The minute we got to the site and he knew that there was a truck in the way. Q. Then what did he do? A. I think he was the one that went to get the manager and make sure they move the truck. Q. How many belts were on the truck? A. For safety there was a lot, we put so many. I think we put more than twelve belts around, all around. MS. FILLMORE: Off the record. (Whereupon, a short lunch recess was taken.) MS. FILLMORE: Back on the record. Q. What type of clothing were you wearing? A. Work clothes. Q. Like what kind? A. I was wearing construction cargo jeans, my boots. I had a shirt, T-shirt or long sleeve, I don't remember. It wasn't hot or cold, it was nice, and my helmet and my gloves. Q. Okay. You said earlier that you were wearing work boots? A. Yes. Q. Do you know the brand? A. Yes, they were Timberland. Q. What color were they? A. Yellowish. Q. Have you ever worn them before? A. If I wore them before, yes. Q. Are they rubber-soled shoes? A.

Did you have a cell phone on the date of the accident? A. Yes. Q. Where was it? A. In my pocket. Q. In your what? A. Pocket, my pocket. Q. Okay. Was anything in your hands at the time of the accident? A. Yes, we was putting a panel down. Q. Okay. You were putting the panel down when the accident occurred? A. Yes. Q. Was someone else taking down a panel after you took down one? A. No. Q. Okay. A. It was two guys for one panel. Q. Let me ask it this way. Was another panel being taken down when the accident occurred? A. No. Q. Okay. Who was supervising that particular portion of the project? A. The portion of -Q. The supervisor? A. Who was the supervisor? Q. Yeah, who was supervising that particular portion of like the unload? A. Nobody, actually the unloading we were in charge. But the guys that were passing the panels was two guys. Q. Who was that? A. That was Fidel and the other one that I don't remember the name. Q. So, it was you, Fidel and the guy you can't remember? A. There's four of us. Q. Who is the other one? A. Felipe, Fidel and me, and the guy I don't remember. Q. Okay. Was there any particular person that stood out that gave any orders during that particular portion of it? A. No. Q. So you all just knew what to do and did it? A. Yes, to unload it and put it on the floor so the crane can take it up. Q. Got it. Did you put the panels on the floor or on the crane? A. On the floor. Q. To put on the crane. They were supposed to go from the truck to the floor to the crane; correct? A. From the truck to the floor and the crane picks it up from the floor. Q. Okay, I see what's going on here. How did it work? Did two of you take one panel off and then the next two would take the next panel off? A. They pass the panel, they have to wait until we put it down and like that we go back up with the hands up and grab another one. Q. I see. There were two people on the truck and then two people on the ground? A. Exactly. Q. You were on the ground with? A. Felipe. Q. So you and Felipe were on the ground and the guy you couldn't remember and Fidel were on the truck? A. Yes. Q. How many panels were on the truck? MR. GROSSMAN: At what time, in the beginning when they first started? MS. FILLMORE: Okay, withdraw that. Q. When you got there how many panels were on the truck? A. We didn't count, but it was a lot. It was a full truck. Q. Can you approximate how many panels? A. We had two trucks. MR. GROSSMAN: Just the one truck she's talking about. Q. Yeah, the one truck you were working on? A. The one I was working on. Okay, that one it had beams and panels. It had a lot, maybe like more than 30 -- like maybe more than 30. Q. Okay. How many panels had been taken off the truck when the accident occurred? A. We was almost maybe more than half. Q. So you were more than halfway through unloading? A. Yes. Q. Explain to me how the accident happened? A. Well, like I was saying, I was working on the ground with Felipe. Me and him, we was the ones holding the panels and putting it down on the floor so the crane could take it up. So my job was grab it one side, Felipe the other side, we both go down and put it on the floor and repeatedly we was doing that repeatedly. Q. And then what happened? A. And then once we was carrying the long ones because the long ones we had to put a space because they are longer. So that's what we're doing. So when they pass me one, I grab it from my side and then Felipe grabbed it from his side, so he comes in front of me because he has to get in front of me so we can put it in front between us. So when we're turning to go down, bending down to put it that's when they told me because all I did is feel the impact and I blacked out. And what they told me is that they dragged me from there to a wall so I could just sit back on the wall until I wake up and that's when I wake up. I woke up bleeding from my mouth like acting crazy because I didn't know what happened. So that's when they told me, calm down, calm down, a panel just fell on you. And I was like, how, how. They told me to stay seated for a little bit. I just felt an impact on the back of my head, I mean my neck. And then from there like men was passing, my neck was getting still and hard and heavy and that's when the owner came down John Junior and I told me what happened. The guys explained to him what happened. He said can you get you, can you sit in the truck and i said I can't. So they carried me to the truck and they sat me in me on the truck until they finished unloading what was left on the truck and then they took me to the warehouse. MR. GROSSMAN: Okay. Hold up there, you don't have to tell her the whole story. Q. Yeah. Okay, so now we're going to go back through it. You said that you felt an impact on the back of your head. Did you ever see anything that might alert you to the fact that you were about to get hit by something? A. I didn't see anything. Q. Nothing? A. Nothing. Q. When you felt the impact were you in the middle of putting the panel down on the ground? A. Yes, I was bending down to put the panel down when I just felt an impact. Q. Did you get the panel on the ground before the impact? A. Well, I was in the moment that the impact, so I don't know if I end up putting down on the floor. MR. GROSSMAN: Excuse me, could we take a two second break, please? MS. FILLMORE: Yeah. (Whereupon, a short recess was taken.) MS. FILLMORE: Back on the record. Q. Were you in the process of like coming back up from bending down? A. Yes. Q. Okay. A. Well, the process, the first panel that passed we was putting it down, so we was putting it down. I think yes, I was coming back up. Q. Okay. Did you hear anybody say anything prior to the impact? A. No, I didn't. Q. Did you hear anybody yell anything prior to the accident, prior to the impact? A. No, I didn't. Q. Okay. After the impact when was the first time you remember anything I guess? I can ask that differently. What do you remember like after the accident? A. When I woke up? Q. Uh-huh. A. I remember just feeling an impact on my head and the back of my neck, like behind me and that's when I felt that falling on me and I blacked out. I don't remember nothing, I fainted. They told me I fainted. Q. What's the first thing you remember after that? A. After I woke up? Q. Yeah. A. I was sitting down and I just saw everybody in front of me worried about me. I was sitting down on the floor of course. Q. What time did the accident occur? A. The last time I saw a time was like one or twelve something, so I don't really know. I wasn't looking at my phone or my time. Q. Do you know what date the accident occurred? A. Of course, Friday. Q. What's the date? A. December 20th, 2019. Q. Okay. Where were you looking immediately prior to feeling the impact? A. Where I was looking? Q. Uh-huh. A. Like I was getting back up, I was looking at my partner, staring at my partner. Q. Did his facial expressions when you were looking at him indicate that something was about to hit you? A. I just saw his eyes opening like I didn't expect it to me or I didn't expect anything that was going to happen. Q. Of course. What do you mean, do you mean like his eyes widened? A. Yeah, opened up. Q. Like surprised? A. Like a surprise thing. Q. And then you woke up on the ground? A. Yes, I felt the impact like I said. Q. Okay. Did they tell you how long you were out for? A. Actually I asked them how long I was out, they told me for more than ten seconds. Q. Was it more than 30 seconds? A. I think so. Q. More than a minute? A. No. Q. Okay. When you woke up on the ground who spoke to you first? A. First first? Q. Yeah. A. Well, I think the three guys I was working with in the ground, that's the first three persons I saw in front of me. So it was everybody talking to me at the same time when I woke up. Q. What was the first thing that someone said that you could understand? A. If I'm good, what do I feel. Q. Okay. Do you know who said that? A. I think it was the guy whose name I don't remember. I don't know why I don't remember his name. His name is like in Spanish is complicated. Q. Okay. What did you tell them when they asked you that? A. I told them like what, like my -- I was just surprised like in shock of what happened. Because the first thing when I woke up I was bleeding from my mouth. So my first thought was because I felt the impact on my head, you know. So my first was like I'm bleeding from inside, like from my head, inside bleeding and I was in shock, I was in shock. Q. Okay. So you didn't like cut your mouth open, you were bleeding from -you had blood in your mouth? A. Yes, they told me because of the impact. Q. Is that what the doctor told you? A. That's what the nurse told me because I was talking while I was putting the panels. The panel hit my head, if you're bleeding from your tongue it means it closed. Q. Did you bite your tongue? A. Yes, I did. Q. What were you saying? A. I was spitting, I'm bleeding through my head -Q. No, you said you were talking when the impact occurred. What were you saying? A. I just said I was in shock because I'm bleeding. MR. GROSSMAN: That's not the question, listen to the question. She wants to know if you were talking when you were hit? A. No, I wasn't talking. Q. I thought that's what you said and that's why you bit your tongue. Let me just recalibrate here. MS. FILLMORE: Counsel, I think we're going to call for the names, contact info of Felipe, Fidel and this guy that he can't remember the name of. MR. GROSSMAN: Are you asking me, I have no idea. MS. FILLMORE: I'm going to call for it in writing. MR. GROSSMAN: Don't ask me, you can ask Michael. MS. FILLMORE: Yeah, I meant on the record I'm just going to request that in writing. Actually, yeah that's a good idea. Q. Do you have any contact information for Felipe or Fidel? A. You're asking me? Q. Yes. A. I think I have one of them. Q. I mean we can also just get that from Five Star as well. Okay, that's fine. I'll ask that later. Did you hear anything out of the ordinary immediately prior to the impact? A. I didn't hear anything. I was hit in my back, I didn't hear nothing. Because the truck is height, so you can't really hear. Q. Where were both your hands at the time of the impact? A. Like on the sides of me because I just put a panel, so they were on the sides of my body. Q. You had just put the panel down; correct? A. Uh-huh. Q. And you were in the process of coming back up? A. Coming back up with my arms next to the sides of my body. Q. Okay. And then where were both of your feet at the time of the impact? A. Where? Q. Yeah, where were both of your feet at the time of the impact? A. My feet was on the floor. I kind of don't understand your question, on the floor. Q. Okay. Between the time of the impact and when you woke up on the ground, what do you know about what occurred during that time? A. That a panel had hit me. Q. What I'm asking is, what did they tell you occurred between the time you blacked out and the time you woke up on the floor? A. They told me that the panel hit me and that I was knocked out and that they had to drag me out from where the accident happened. That's all they told me and then when I woke up if I was okay, what was hurting me. Q. What did you tell them? A. I told them that I felt the impact and I just told them like it hit me really hard because it knocked me out and they were like, yes, it did. Q. How was the weather that day? A. The weather, well we didn't have no jacket on. I had like a long sleeve, it wasn't that bad to me. Q. Was it windy? A. Sometimes it was. Q. Did Felipe ever tell you like how he saw the accident happen? MR. GROSSMAN: Objection. What do you mean how he saw it? MS. FILLMORE: That's true, I knew that was coming. Q. What did Felipe tell you about the accident? A. All he told me that it really went down and hit you hard. That's all they told me, I wasn't really talking because I was in shock. MR. GROSSMAN: She didn't ask about you, she didn't ask one word about what you were doing. She only asked about what Felipe told you, listen to the question. A. Yeah, what I told you. That's all. Q. So Felipe didn't tell you exactly how like the accident happened as how he saw it? A. No. Q. Then you said John Junior came down from the roof? A. Yes. Q. And what did he do? A. He came and asked me if I was all right. Q. What did you tell him? A. I told him I guess. Q. What did he say to that? A. He said yeah, something hit you. And I was like yes, I know. He just told me to relax and stay seated and to not do anything else until they finish and I was like okay. So I couldn't get up, they took me to the truck. Q. Who took you to the truck? A. It was Felipe and him. Q. Okay. Could you walk? A. It was hard for me to walk, my legs were weak. That's why they carried me. Q. When they took you to the truck, what happened next? A. They just told me to stay seated, to try not to move and just to wait until they finished unloading the truck so we could leave. Q. Okay. How long did you sit in the truck before you were able to leave? A. I think probably maybe like Q. Okay. Did anybody come and check on you during that time? A. Yes. Q.

Did you ever fill out any incident reports following this accident? A. Like after the accident? Q. Uh-huh. A. Like, I don't understand your question. Q. Like with the company per se? A. No. Q. Okay. Were you asked to fill one out? A. No. Q. Okay. Did anyone else prepare an incident report on your behalf? A. No. Q. Did you ever see any incident reports that were completed on your behalf? A. No. Q. Did anyone call 911? A. No. Q. Did you take an ambulance to the hospital when you went? A. Did they take me in an ambulance? Q. Uh-huh. A. No. Q. Did you take any pictures at the scene? A. No, I was too weak and I couldn't do anything. Q. Did anybody else take any pictures at the scene? A. No. That I know, no. Q. When did you decide to go to the hospital? A. Why or when? Q. When? A. When, I think it was a day after. Why? Q. No. So you went to the hospital the day after you said? A. Yeah, like Friday, Saturday, I went Sunday morning. Q. Sunday morning? A. Yes. Q. So two days after? A. Saturday -- I don't really remember, but I guess my lawyer has that on file. Q. Technically so do I, but I have to ask you? A. Sorry, I don't remember. Q. It's okay. So it's either Saturday or Sunday? A. Yeah. Q. Why did you decide to go to the hospital? A. Because I saw that I was really not able to move my neck at all, I couldn't move at all and I was super swollen and my mom was like you need to go. I didn't want to go. When they saw how I was doing, you need to go and they took me. Q. Who took you? A. My cousin. Q. Your cousin and your mom? A. Actually my cousin. Q. What is your cousin's name? A. Bryant, B-R-Y-A-N-T. MR. GROSSMAN: Off the record a second. (Whereupon, an off-the-record discussion was held.) MS. FILLMORE: Back on the record. Q. Did you go to a hospital or did you go to Urgent Care? A. Urgent Care. Q. What's the name of the Urgent Care? A. It's actually -- I remember it was Urgent Care, but it says EM something. I don't really remember. City something. Q. If I said CityMD would that refresh your recollection? A. I remember it was Urgent Care. I don't remember it was CityMD. Q. You said your cousin Bryant took you? A. Yes. Q. Did you vomit at any point between when you got home and when you went to Urgent Care? A. When I was home. Q. When you went home? A. Yes. Q. How many times? A. Twice. Q. Sorry, I don't want to talk about vomit but I have to. What did you tell the staff at CityMD when you arrived? A. I told them that I was in so much pain in my neck and that I couldn't move it and I showed them that I couldn't move it and I showed them that I was swollen a lot. Q. Did you have any headaches? A. Yes. Q. Like how long did they persist? A. Constantly, it was like a light headache but it was there. Q. What part of the head hurt? A. All around. Q. Okay. What did they do for you at CityMD? A. The first thing they did is they did the X-rays for the neck and that's it. Q. Were there any other X-rays done? A. In there, just for the neck. Because they asked me where was the impact and I said it was in the neck. Q. What did they tell you about the X-rays? A. They told me that I was too swollen, that they couldn't really see the issue of what was going on. They told me to take Tylenol and to make ASAP appointment with my primary doctor so she could check me out and that's exactly what happened. Q. Okay. Were you given any prescriptions? A. Tylenol. Q. Where did you fill those? A. Where? Q. Yeah. A. What pharmacy you mean? Q. Yeah. A. Around my way in Ridgewood. Q. Do you know what it's called? A. Nature Pharmacy. MS. FILLMORE: Counsel, I'm just going to call for production an authorization for Nature Pharmacy and I'll follow-up in writing. Q. Did they give you any stitches? A. No. Q. Did they give you any kind of like neck brace or wraps or anything? A. They just told me to put ice and to take the Tylenol as directed. Q. Okay. Dr. Elsa Reyes is your primary care physician; correct? A. Yes. Q. Do you know where she's located? A. She is in Ridgewood, Queens. Q. When was the last time you saw her? A. I was there a few months ago. Q. I'm just going to clarify this so we don't have any road blocks. Have you treated with her for these injuries? A. No, I just told her what happened to me. Q. When did you go to see her? A. When Urgent Care told me I had to call my primary care doctor and make an appointment. I tried to see her as soon as I can, but I saw her -- it wasn't Monday, it was a Wednesday like a week later. Q. Okay. What did you tell her? A. I told her what happened to me because she asked me. Q. You just told her the whole accident? A. Yes, she told me what hit me and I told her what hit me. Q. What did she say? A. She said, wow, you're lucky to walk. Q. Okay. What did she do for you? A. Then she started treating me, checking -- she sent me to do X-rays I remember. Q. Uh-huh. A. Of my neck because that was where I got hurt. Q. Okay. A. And from there she's going to send me to a specialist, but that's when I called workers' comp and they sent me to another place. Q. Okay, let's go back just a little bit. When did John Junior call you after the accident? A. He called me -- that same day, he called me at nighttime and asked me how I was. Q. He called you and asked you how you were? A. Yes. Q. What did you tell him? A. I just told him that I wasn't feeling good, that I was just laying in bed. Q. And what did he say? A. He said take the pills I gave you, you'll be ready and better by next week. He was just giving me something like a fast way for me to feel up, to cheer up. It wasn't helping. Q. Going back to your primary care physician. You said she wanted to send you to a specialist? A. Yes. Q. But then you called workers' comp? A. Yeah, that's when the issue happened and I called workers' comp. Q. Then who did you treat with next? A. I treated with CityMD. Q. You said CityMD? A. Yes. Q. Was the place that you went to the first time the same place that you went like after you went to your primary care physician? A. Excuse me again? MR. GROSSMAN: You said you went to CityMD. She thinks you went twice, did you go twice? THE WITNESS: No. MR. GROSSMAN: Then you're not listening to the question. You went to CityMD first, then you went to your primary physician. Now, she wants to know where you went next. THE WITNESS: No, first I went to the primary. MR. GROSSMAN: First primary, and then CityMD and then where did you go? THE WITNESS: I was in CityMD after that. MR. GROSSMAN: We did CityMD already. What's next, that's what she wants to know? THE WITNESS: I started doing therapy there. I didn't do nothing else. MS. FILLMORE: Okay, I think maybe the place that he went before the primary care physician was not CityMD, like a different Urgent Care. MR. GROSSMAN: It's called CityMD Urgent Care. A. Woodhaven. MS. FILLMORE: Off the record. (Whereupon, an off-the-record discussion was held.) MS. FILLMORE: Counsel, I'm going to call for production of an authorization to the CityMD. MR. GROSSMAN: You have all the authorizations already. MS. FILLMORE: I just always say that to cover my bases, I believe you. Except for the pharmacy. MR. GROSSMAN: Okay. Q. So we have a list, we have CityMD, then we have your primary care physician and then we have CityMD, got it. What doctor did you see at CityMD? A. They sent me first to see the pain management, yeah. Q. Who was that? A. The names, I don't recall the names. It's kind of hard the names. Q. Was it a female or male or both? A. It was a male. Q. Okay. Was it Dr. Joseph Bater, B-A-T-E-R? A. No. Q. Okay, that's fine. When did you see him? A. I think it was as soon as they sent me there, I think it was on February of 2020. Q. Okay. Who referred you to this facility? A. Workers' comp. Q. Okay. What were your complaints to the doctor? A. My neck and my -- my neck was the main complaint. Q. Like what about your neck? A. What I told him, I told him that I couldn't move it. I was swollen and that I couldn't turn left or right, that I I could just look straight. So that's when we are like we are going to send you to get MRIs so we can see what's wrong with your neck. Q. Okay. Where did you get the MRIs done? A. In CityMD. Q. Okay. When did you get the MRIs done? A. Like a week after -- the same week that I was there. Q. Did he tell you the results of those MRIs? A. Yes, he did. Q. What did they say? A. That I had three dislocated or two discs dislocated on my neck. And then they put me in the MRI machine, they saw that I have more pains, more issues in the shoulder that it was swollen from inside and then they noticed that I had swelling in my elbow from inside tissue and then the lower back pain came after. Q. Okay. What did they say about it though, what did they tell you was happening? A. They said I have dislocated discs, that I needed therapy and then I needed to see a neck specialist and a shoulder specialist and an elbow specialist and a back specialist, so they could see the issue more deeper and they could tell me what happened or what was problem. Q. Okay. Did you get MRIs for your right elbow or your right shoulder? A. Yes, I did. Q. When were those? A. Where, in CityMD. Q. No, when? A. When, that was between February 2020. Q. So for both the shoulder and the elbow? A. Yes, at the same time I did that. Q. Okay. What did they say was the issue with the right shoulder? A. The right shoulder, that I have damaged tissue. Q. What about the elbow? A. The same thing, they saw like a muscle damage. I don't remember the name he told me, but he saw that the muscle in my elbow was already -- it was already damaged as well. Q. Okay. What did the doctor say that he could do for your neck? A. At first he told me let's do treatment. Q. Okay. A. And then we would talk about surgery after they told me. Yeah, they did tell me that I needed surgery on my neck because the dislocated disc. Q. Did they tell you that you needed it right away or were you going to do PT first? A. No, they told me that the PT goes first and then when the referral approves the surgery we'll get the surgery done quick. That's what they told me. Q. How long did it take for the surgery to be approved? A. I think it took like two months, not even. Q. What did they say they could do about the right shoulder? A. What did they say, that they was going to fix and clean my tissue -damaged tissue. Q. They said surgery; correct? A. Yes. Q. And then what about your right elbow? A. The same thing, that I needed surgery because I have damaged tissue on my elbow. Q. Do you know what doctor told you that? A. What doctor, Corso. Q. Is Dr. Corso at CityMD? A. Yes. Q.

You've been getting physical therapy three times a week since A. Yes. Q. Was there ever a time that you didn't go? A. Yes. Q. When? A. There was times that my lower back gives up out on me and I can't get up from bed, I can't. Q. Did you continue going through the pandemic? A. Yes. Q. Did you have to do it from home at any point or were you still able to go in? A. At the beginning we would still be able to go in until they said that everything had to shut down, so I was doing it through Zoom. Q. Okay. Have your injuries improved since you started physical therapy? A. No. Q. It's the same pain you felt at the beginning? A. It has mild, but the lower back is the main issue right now. Q. Okay. A. It's like the pain is there. Q. What did they say about your lower back? A. I have dislocated disc and they said treatment for now and to see if surgery is needed. Q. Have they told you that surgery is required yet? A. That's why they are going to do the MRIs and that CAT scan and all that, because they want to make sure. Q. Okay. What kind of physical therapy would you do on a good day? A. I do what I have to do, chiro, acupuncture. And let's say today for example, I have four injuries. I could only do one, so I go for the one that hurts more or for what is sore. So I try to rotate, but most of the time I take more therapy for the neck and back because it's the main pain. Q. What kind of physical therapy do you do? A. They just put those -- the electroshock things on damage tissue or muscle and then after that 20 minutes, I do the bike for the neck or it's the low back, I do exercises for my lower back. It depends what treatment I'm doing there. Q. Okay. Did they give you exercises to do at home? A. They told me to do that. Q. Does it ever improve like that day? A. No, the pain comes back. Q. Have they worsened? A. The low back has. Q. Okay. I'm trying to get an idea of like -- do you see all the doctors for all the things when you go to CityMD? A. Yes. Q. So every single doctor? A. Yes. Q. Dr. Goltzberg? A. Goltzberg, I have to see still because she is the one that did my shoulder. Q. Yeah. A. I see her once a month. Q. Okay. And does she say why? A. Why specific? Q. Yeah. A. Why I see her once a month? Q. Yeah, is she just checking on it or is she like -A. She has to check on it. Q. Okay. A. To see if I still need treatment and how is the pain or what I'm feeling. Q. Okay. How often do you see Dr. Corso now? A. Corso, I'm seeing him once a month right now, too. Q. What about Goltzberg? A. I see -- most of the doctors is once a month. Q. How often do you see your psychologist? A. My psychologist. I ain't going to lie, I don't really see her often. Q. How often do you see her? A. When I really need to see her. Q. When is that? A. When I feel like I'm stuck in a box. Like when anxiety really hits me and I feel like I'm going crazy, that's when I call her and tell her if I go see her, but I don't really see her often. Q. When was the last time you saw her? A. By the start of this year, the first month of this year. Q. You started in January? A. Yeah, I saw her January. That was the last time I saw her. Q. Okay. Do you have any future appointments with her? A. No, I call her when I want to go see her. Q. Okay. A. That's why I said when I feel like seeing her I see her. Q. For your right shoulder surgery did Dr. Steele tell you like what surgery you needed? A. Yes. Q. The name of it? A. All I know that she told me that a nerve muscle, that it was damaged. It came from the neck. Q. Okay. A. And that's the reason I have so much swelling and pain there. Q. Okay. Do you see Dr. Tripathi once a month as well? A. Yes. Q. Did any other doctors that we haven't discussed recommend surgery? A. No. Q. And you've only treated at CityMD; correct? A. Yes. Q. Except for the psychologist? A. Yes. Q. Have you had nerve testing done? A. Yes, they actually did that recently on my -- for my lower, down. Q. Okay. How recently are we talking about? A. A month ago. Q. Did you have one previously? A. Yes, that's the one that I just had a month ago. Q. Did you have one in February of A. I don't remember. Q. That's okay. As of today, has any other doctor recommended further surgery? A. No. Q. Did you ever receive cortisone injections? A. If I receive injections? Q. Yeah. MR. GROSSMAN: Cortisone injections? A. Yes. Q. How many times? A. I think they gave me like four or five in total. I don't really know. Q. Who gave them to you? A. Mr. Goldberg -- Goodstein, Goodstein, I'm sorry. Q. It's okay. Did they make any recommendations for future injections? A. Yes. Q. When did you get the injections? A. When, the last one I got two months ago if I'm not mistaken, two or three months ago. Q. When were the ones before? A. Where, what part of my body? Q. When? A. When, the date? Q. You could do like a month or the year? A. The last one was -- 2021 was the last one, at the end of December. Q. Were they all at the same time? A. No. Q. How many would you get per session? A. Two. Q. So two each? A. Uh-huh. Q. Where were they given? A. One was in my neck and the other one in my lower back. Q. You said they recommended further injections? A. Yes. Q. Okay. Do you plan to undergo those? A. I don't know, because -- I don't know. Q. Did the injections help at all? A. Only once. After all of them, it helped once. Q. Okay. So only one helped, like one out of four helped? A. Yeah, one out of four. An example, my neck. Q. The one in the neck, okay. How long did that provide relief for? A. It was supposed to last me for -- they told me for two to three months, it didn't last me more than two weeks. Q.
