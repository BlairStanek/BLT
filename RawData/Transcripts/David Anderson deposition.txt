Creighton University School of Medicine. I then went to residency at the University of Kansas Medical Center, followed by the Harvard Combined Orthopedic Program for adult reconstruction subspecialty training at Massachusetts General Hospital. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. So what is a residency, Doctor? A. It's a training program after medical school for specialty training -- surgical training for my --in my case. Q. So after you became a medical doctor? A. Yes, sir. Q. And then following that you had some additional fellowship training? A. Yes. Q. And what is that, please? A. So fellowship is when we spend an additional year after our residency training to a subspecialty. So for me it's -- the parts of the body were the hip and the knee, specifically in the adult patients, although I do take care of some adolescent patients upon referral, but mainly adult patients is what my training was with that year -- that extra additional year. Q. Have you en- -- engaged in any research, writing, or training -- teaching, rather? A. I've done all of the above. Q. Can you give us sort of an idea -- an overview of the extent of -6 (Whereupon, there is simultaneous crosstalk.) BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. -- those things? A. Yeah. So most of my research after graduate school -- most of my research was centered with orthopedics. I've done hip and knee research. Part of that was with training residents where we'd have research projects with residents as part of their training, and I supervised those. Since I've changed practices out of the academic in 2017, I've mainly just been teaching, though I have written a textbook chapter. I've written articles before for -- and for publication in orthopedic journals. I've written textbook chapters for The Adult Knee, which just got published in the last two years during COVID. Q. So I was gonna ask you -- and I apologize for interrupting you, but would -- would those articles include the subject of -- of total knee replacements for patients? A. Yeah, so in the adult knee -- and I think the editors are Rubash, Callaghan, Rosenberg -- it just got published most recently. It's the most up-to-date book on that. I wrote the textbook chapter, "The Varus Knee." That's the most common osteoarthritic knee condition leading to knee reconstruction, knee replacement in adults. And so I --I wrote -- I wrote that chapter. I also teach. I actively teach on revision knees and robotic knee reconstruction. So next week I'm teaching a two-day course on knee replacement utilizing robotics. So I'm actively engaged in teaching. Q. You said "revision knees." What is that? A. That's -- there's -- so that's redoing a failed knee replacement. So there's a number of reasons that a knee replacement can fail. A revision knee is when we go in and -- and correct that problem either with a single-component or a multiple-component exchange of a knee. So it's a little bit more complex than a primary, first-time knee replacement. But that's that's been a substantial portion of my practice since I came out of training. Q. That is revisions, redoing knee replacements? A. Yes. Q. What are some of the more common causes for the need for a revision knee procedure? A. In contemporary times the most common reasons are infection, instability, or component loosening. There's been historical component failure with the polyethylene -- which is the plastic piece between the two metal components --was not as good as what we have available now. Those would fail. There's also metallurgy problems historically, but, since about the year 2000 to 2002, those problems have decreased. So instability, infection, and component loosening from the bone would be the most common reasons we see in our practice. I think the literature would support that as well. Q. Okay. Very good. Did -- can you tell us how how -- well, let me back up for a minute. Are you familiar with a fellow orthopedic surgeon by the name of Dr. John Sojka? A. I am. Q. How do you know Dr. Sojka? A. We were practice partners from 2012 through 2017, and he also was one of the people who trained me when I was at the University of Kansas in my residency program. So I know him pretty well. Q. Okay. How was it that you came to see Chris Walls? A. It was upon referral from Dr. Sojka. Q. Okay. And under -- what were the circumstances under which Dr. Sojka referred Chris Walls as a patient to you? A. Dr. Sojka referred Mr. Walls as a post-traumatic arthritis patient. So the complexity of his knee and the soft-tissue injuries were something I'm familiar with. I'd done a number of these when I was at the University of Kansas as a staff member there, as an academic surgeon; so I had a lot of experience with that, and Dr. Sojka asked me to see the patient due to his cartilage injury and the post-traumatic arthritis he had in light of the retained deep implants that he had from his tibial plateau reconstruction and the soft tissue injuries below his knee. Q. So that's a -- that's a --that's a lot -- a mouthful. What -- what are you talking about when you -- when you refer to Mr. Walls as a complex knee presentation? A. Well, let's -- I think the easier way to look at it is what's a simple knee presentation -- would be your routine osteoarthritis. And so people who are geriatric, usually over the age of 65, who have what most laypeople would consider to be wear and tear arthritis. So as we age we can have cartilage degeneration and whatnot, which can lead to arthritic conditions of the knee -- which most people think of our grandma and grandpas having that type of routine arthritis. The complex patient would be the opposite of that -- somebody who has had a previous injury to their knee, who has retained deep implants, who has some type of ligamentous injury or soft tissue injury or something that's gonna make it more difficult to heal or have a normal outcome after a knee replacement, was what we --we -- would be considered a more complex knee replacement. Q. Okay. Then when did you first see Mr. Walls in this case? A. I don't remember the exact date. I'd have to look at my records. Q. No, that's all right. I've -- I've got it in front of me, and if it -- if it sounds about accurate, we'll go with that and you can tell us, to the best of your recollection, that initial visit. I have it at January 8th of 2021. And we can pull up that note if that would be helpful? A. That sounds about right to me. If you want to pull the note up, that's fine also. Q. And my question to you to begin with is what was Mr. Walls's presentation? What was the history that you -- you received with Mr. Walls from Dr. Sojka and Mr. Walls himself? A. Yeah, so what's nice about the relationship Sojka and I have is we know each other as we -- he'll usually call me to give me heads up about these patients beforehand; so he kind of gave me a -- his verbal history, and then I'm able to talk with the patient and sit down with them in clinic and kind of go over what their history was. But, in essence and I think you have Dr. Sojka's notes also, but patient had compartment syndrome with a fasciotomy with a Schatzker VI tibial plateau fracture, I believe, which is essentially a crush injury to his lower extremity, which is a limb-threatening injury. And Dr. Sojka had done a nice job preserving his soft tissue and reconstructing his bone for a --a good base for -for what he needed later, which would be a knee reconstruction by me. But, anyway, he had retained deep implants, if I recall, with medial and lateral tibial plateau plates and multiple screws, multiple incisions about his knee. He'd had a previous external fixator on to allow his soft tissues to calm down before Dr. Sojka had done his -- what -- what Dr. Sojka's definitive treatment was, which was the reconstruction of his tibial plateau and treating his soft-tissue injury. And then he kind of talked to the patient about what his function was at that time, his quality of life, inability to sleep due to the pain. These are very painful injuries, and they have chronic pain secondary to the nerve and just the soft-tissue injury. So we -- we would -- we would have discussed all that. Q. Okay. And what is -how would you -how would you describe "compartment syndrome"? A. So the way I describe this to patients who don't have a knowledge of the anatomy is the way our muscles are made, they sit into a sac. If you look at a steak, it's got the white fibers in it. The white fibers is fascia. And it's got thick almost canvas-y material that encases our bones. It's like a balloon over our bones. When we have an injury that causes bleeding in these muscles, that's a confined space around those muscles, and it's trying to -the -- the bleeding into that and soft tissue swelling from an injury expands those muscles within that finite space, and so it gets very, very tight. And as that happens, it can cut off blood supply; it can damage the nerves. And so compartment syndrome is a orthopedic emergency that requires fasciotomies, which is opening up that layer -5 fascia layer to release that pressure in order to preserve function the best we can in the future. Q. So I think you referred to his presentation, or at least Mr. Walls's condition, as -- as "limb-threatening," and by that, I'm assuming you mean he could have lost his leg. A. That's correct. MS. DALLON: Object to form. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. It --what -- what is it about the injury that causes it to be, in your opinion, limb threatening at the time? A. With a bicondylar tibial plateau fracture, which is when, at the top of our shinbone, it breaks in a pattern such that the bottom part of the knee splits into at least two, if not more, different pieces and essentially functions like a dislocation of the knee. And bone bleeds extensively. Bone has an incredibly good bud -- blood supply, and so what it does is --is as the -- as the knee moves, because it doesn't have the stability from a non-broken bone, it essentially act -- functions as a knee dislocation. That can damage the nerves and blood vessels around the limb. And so those are treated as an emergent procedure in order to save the leg. And so his initial injury would have been considered limb threatening requiring fasciotomies, requiring an external fixator and multiple procedures in order to save his leg. I mean, that's -- that's what I mean by that. Q. Okay. Then you also, as did Dr. Sojka, refer to what's called a "Schatzker VI fracture"? A. Yes, sir. Q. What is that? A. The Schatzker classification looks at the -- the degree of injury to the knee; it looks at the bony breakage pattern. So it's classified via that. And so I think most of what today's surgeons consider the Schatzker VI would be the most complex, most most devastating injury as far as tibial plateau fractures go. And so it's the pattern of his injury within that classification system. Q. Does that mean in layman's term his knee --the bones in the knee -- the tibia, fibula -- that that make up the tibial plateau were -- were smashed? A. Essentially his tibia -- I'd have to look at his CT scan to see if his fibula was involved. It's typically just the -- the tibia, but, yeah, essentially that -- it is a crush injury. And, yes, I think I would describe that to patients as "You smashed your tibia." I think most people would understand that. MR. LeNEAVE: Josh, are you able to pull up one of those medical exhibits that might help and as -as we go through this? I'm not sure that we have one showing that. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. But the --there was also a term used about "comminutia" -- comminution -- comminuted fracture. Is that part of the Schatzker VI criteria, or presentation? A. It is, but comminution is used more generally discussing multiple fragments of bone. So comminution is not specific to Schatzker classification; it's -- it's any fracture. Q. Sure. A. We describe it as being "comminuted" or "not comminuted." And comminuted would be -- it has a lot of small pieces. Q. And in this case it was comminuted fractures? A. Yes. Q. All right. And what does that -- what is the significance of a comminuted fracture or fractures in terms of the management, care, and the outcome for the patient? A. Are you talking specifically to this tibial plateau fracture? Q. Yes. A. So with the tibial plateau fracture, that is the part of the tibia that is closest to the joint line. The joint line is what contains the cartilage, which is the smooth surface that allows our joints to glide normally. So many of those fragments pictured here would have cartilage attached to them. When they get damaged with comminution or being "smashed up," as you described it, those -- that cartilage takes a significant injury from sheer forces and compression forces from -- from that -- that injury. And so that relates to the future outcome and viability of those cartilage cells, whether they're going to stay viable or they're going to degrade in the future, which is what occurred in this patient. Q. Okay. If we go back to your initial visit, then, on January 8th of 2021, were you able to, based on your -- your -- your review of the presenting history and the information that you -- that you had, that you form an assessment and -- and a plan? A. Yes, I was able to discuss the patient's history and his physical exam. We did -- we did come up with a plan at that point in time. Q. And what was the plan? A. So it's fairly typical for these types of injuries in my practice -- people have had multiple incisions throughout their knee. I tend to take out the deep implants first, allow the soft tissue to recover, and then come back later, once the soft tissue is recovered, and -- and do a total knee replacement. Q. Okay. So at that point -- and presumably this was why Dr. Sojka sent Mr. Walls to you, was with the idea that he was a candidate for a total knee arthroplasty? A. Yes. He had developed severe post-traumatic arthritis and motion deficit at that point in time. Q. And so let's talk about that for a moment. What is severe post-traumatic arthritis? What does that mean in the context of this case? A. So most of us grade arthritis in the -- fairly simply -- mild, moderate, and severe. Severe obviously being the worst. And so he had bad arthritis, to put it in layman's terms. What was -- the second part of your question was? Q. So what does that -- what is the arthritis, this severe arthritis -- what is the significance of that in terms of your development of a plan to -- to care and treat the patient? A. Yeah, so I look at their age and their functional level, their goals, what expectations are, and so, because of his severe pain and the exam of his knee, we discussed doing a total knee arthroplasty even though he's younger than what those implants were originally designed for. Those implants were designed for -- originally back in the 1970s and earlier for patients of geriatric age, and we've applied them to younger patients with injuries like this or other deficits as the implants and the polyethylenes -the plastics -have improved. And so we discussed that and the fact that -- as far as quality of life and being able to ambulate around the house and have a -- a most normal life as he can after one of these types of injuries, try to limit his pain the best we can. We discussed doing a total knee arthroplasty. Q. So are you saying that typically at -at the -- at the outset, these total knee arthroplasties, these knee replacements, were developed and for -- for patients 65 or older? A. Well, I don't think -- for geriatric patients. So if you look at the history of hip and knee surgery, if we look at what we were treating as far as osteoarthritis goes, back in the '60s and '70s, you know, the thought was to keep people out of wheelchairs, and the -- and that's kind of what we want to do now, is keep people mobile. So that typically applies to a geriatric population. And so you can define that as 65 or 70, whatever your choice is on that, but a geriatric patient. As we age, we get arthritis and the goal is to keep people more active for overall health benefits. Q. Okay. And so in this case you're looking at a total knee arthroplasty on a patient who is -- what? , 46 years of age? A. Yes. Q. And what is -- what's the significance of -- of that, both at the time of the making of the decision to go forward and in the future? A. So the conversation becomes about activity and expectations and longevity of the implants. And so a geriatric patient tends to be more sedentary and have less demand on their joint than somebody in their 40s or 50s, for the most part. There are exceptions to that, but, the most part, geriatric patients are less active than a younger patient. So that becomes the first discussion is "How -- "What are your expectations? What do you want to do with this? Why are you considering having this done?" We look at the whole patient and kind of discuss -8 discuss what's important to them and -- and get realistic expectations for what they want to do. So if somebody tells me they want to play basketball on a knee replacement and they want to run five miles a day at the age of 45 and that's why they want a knee replacement, it's probably not a procedure for them. And so that discussion happens. And you look at also the longevity of the implants, and so, prior to the year 2000, most orthopedic surgeons would tell patients that a hip or a knee replacement would last to 15 years. And a lot of that was because of loosening of the implant, instability, and failure of the components, particularly the plastic. Around the year 2002, newer plastics came out that have less oxidation potential, they're better plastics, and so the studies in the lab would support that these are gonna last many years, hopefully 20 to 30 or even longer years as they've added antioxidants to the plastics. And so I discuss this with the patients from an education standpoint about historical expectations and expectations now. The thing about expectations now, however, we -- most of that data is extrapolated from laboratory data, and so, when we look at the evolution of plastics and what our recommendations are, I tell patients probably 20 to 30 years; but these implants have only been in people 20 years. We know they have "such and such" survivability based on national and international registries, and so we have a discussion about that. Q. So you had this discussion with Mr. Walls, and and what did you learn from him about his -- his hopes, his goals? A. He wanted to be able to walk and not hurt when he stands out of a chair, and he had fairly reasonable expectations. You know, I talked about -- you know, I said -- I usually tell patients who are young enough -- I say, "If you have a child and you want to go kick a soccer ball with them, you probably shouldn't be doing that with your knee replacement, because you could wear it out sooner, you could cause a ligamentous injury, particularly if you had a previous ligamentous injury, such as an -- a Schatzker VI fracture pattern." But I usually discuss -- I'm, like, you know, "This is what I expect you can do, which would be walking, hopefully sleeping without pain. You can expect mild pain, you know, at certain times. If you're very active and the winter occurs you can expect a Level 2 or 3 out of 10 pain. That would be normal for you. But you're not" -- you know, "A perfect outcome is difficult to achieve in a post-traumatic arthritis patient." And so we kind of set the expectation like, you know, limit your activity. We're looking for as pain-free as we can get, but it probably won't be pain-free. If it is, we're very fortunate. But, you know, we kind of talk about expectations like that. Q. Okay. And so together you and Mr. Walls decided that a total knee replacement was a wise course, and you decided to to- -- together to pursue that? A. Yes. Q. And so I think, before you could do that MR. LeNEAVE: And, Josh, you may be able to pull up one of the medical exhibits. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. -- you started to -- to talk about Dr. Sojka's work beforehand, which, of course, included the -- after the external fixator, the internal fixators. And before you could do a total knee, the hardware had to be removed. A. So there's two different thoughts on that. Yes, in my opinion and in my practice, I remove those deep implants first, and it's because there's two incisions involved. And my thought is and my experience is if I take those out on the same day I put a total knee arthroplasty in, that patient has had more swelling and more stiffness afterwards, and they have more pain. So I stage that procedure. Some surgeons would do it all in a single procedure, where they'll make two incisions and take those implants out, put in a knee replacement same day. I can tell you, from having to go in to re-revise those for arthrofibrosis, I have gone to taking out those implants on a separate occasion, and usually six weeks or more later, coming back in and putting a knee replacement in. It's mainly for a soft tissue concern, particularly in somebody who has had a previous compartment syndrome is I want to do the least amount of soft tissue dissection at the time of the knee replacement as possible for the optimal outcome. Q. Okay. So the hardware was removed on March 5th. Did -- did you -- and then there was a pre-op, I know from your -- your records, for the total knee arthroplasty on March 30th of 2021. And it looks to me like you performed the procedure on April 12th of 1. A. That sounds about right. Q. And that's what's depicted in the exhibit that we have posted here. Can you describe the procedure that you performed, then, on MS. DALLON: Before you ask the next question, Mr. LeNeave -- sorry -- I just need to interpose my objection to the exhibit on grounds of hearsay, foundation, and relevance. Thank you. (Whereupon, Exhibit 22, Christopher Walls Hardware Removal and Knee Arthroplasty diagrams, was referenced for questioning.) BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. Well, let me start by this: I think -- is this Exhibit 22? A. I don't --yes, it is. Yes. I see "Exhibit 22" at the top of the screen. Q. Okay. So let me ask you this, Dr. Anderson: Is this -- does this exhibit fairly and accurately depict Mr. Walls's condition as he presented to you and the procedure that you performed? And would it be helpful to use in describing to the jury the procedure that you performed? (Whereupon, there is simultaneous crosstalk.) MS. DALLON: Object to the form of the question. DR. ANDERSON: Yes, this is a fairly reasonable depiction of a total knee arthroplasty. The only difference is I would have used robotic technique, and this does not depict robotic technique. Pretty sure I used a robotic navigation technique with him. It also depicts a fairly normal meniscus coming out, and he did not have a fairly normal meniscus. Otherwise, it is a reasonable depiction of the procedure performed. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. In -- in terms of the hardware and the installation of -- of the hardware, if you will, is it fairly and accurately depicted? A. Yes. Q. So take us through from, you know, for -- for a layman, how you performed this procedure. And I know you've done it hundreds of times. A. So just taking from the surgical incision to completion of surgery, we utilize -- on a post-traumatic knee, typically utilize one of the previous incisions to help preserve the blood supply to the skin; we come down through the subcutaneous tissue, which is the fat below the skin; we then do something called an arthrotomy, which is when we go inline with the fibers of the quadriceps tendon, the medial capsule or retinaculum of the knee and down along the medial or inside part of the patella, and open up the -- the joint; we then slide the patella to a lateral or outside part of the knee. At this point in time I usually examine the knee and make sure the ligament has stability and the ligaments are intact for what I need, mainly being the medial collateral ligament and the lateral collateral ligament. I get an initial assessment of that. For robotic technique, we then place robotic tracker pins on the femur and tibia with some navigation guides for the computer to pick up, for the navigation. We then, with very good precision -- a half millimeter or half a degree of precision -- get a ligamentous exam of the knee as well as a picture of the bony anatomy, which 3-D maps it onto the computer screen, which helps us to make a decision for position of the components. At that point in time, once I make the decision for the position of the components, a robotic arm comes in the field, I make the bony resections, which is shaving off the ends of the bones, which is depicted here. We then trial the components, make sure that that matches up with what the preoperative plan was in the computer screen, again, to a half a millimeter, a half a degree of precision, and then cement in the final components. The main difference on Mr. Walls, as far as a routine knee arthroplasty, is I prepared his tibia with revision components. Q. And so what does that mean? A. My experience with people who have previous severe tibial plateau injuries is that the bone is not normal for cementing into or for bony ingrowth, mainly because they -- when those pieces get put back together, most of the time the bone does mend back fairly reasonably; however, there can be a significant amount of scar tissue between those bone fragments, what we call "fibrous tissue." Fibrous tissue does not -- is not very amenable to cementing. Those components tend the fail early because the bone stock that we are trying to place that implant into is not normal; therefore, I use a more extensive component on the tibia, which is a revision component. And for this particular system, I used a 135-millimeter stem, which is a press-fit stem with splines as well as that clothespin design you see at the end there, to engage the shaft or diaphysis of the tibial bone that helps control rotational stability. In addition, even though he's young, I elected to use a metaphyseal cone. That's that trapezoidal tape piece you see sitting right underneath the port labeled "tibial component." You can see that on the X-rays as well as on that graphical -- the graphic image there. That is a Trabecular Metal cone made out of tantalum. It has a structure very similar to native bone, and the bone grows into that. The implant is cemented into that cone, and it is cemented at the -- the surface -the flat-cut surface, the top of the implant. And so this has what we call "hybrid fixation." The hybrid fixation is the cement and the bony ingrowth portion, which allows this implant to hopefully have very good longevity for as long as we can in this -- in this previously diseased bone. Q. Okay. So you've completed the procedure on Mr. Walls on April 12th of 2021. Did everything go as well as could be expected? A. Yes. Q. You were pleased with the outcome? A. I mean, I -- I -- I -- I --I'm pleased with long-term outcomes. I was certainly pleased with the X-rays and the patient's range of motion at the time of the surgery. I felt we had accomplished the goals of the procedure that we had discussed with the patient. Q. Sure. So you would see the patient, I assume, in in follow-up a time or two? A. I see the patient in follow-up for the longevity of the implant as long as they want to continue to see me. We have -- we have routine follow-up with arthroplasty. I don't just set these patients back free to the wild. We -- we -- we follow up long-term. Q. Okay. So we'll get -- we'll get to that in a minute. Taking a look at -- you had a three-month follow-up on 7/23 of '21. Maybe we can pull that up and take look at it. And I'll just ask you, unless you can recall off the top of your head, Doctor, how was -- how was Mr. Walls doing at three-months follow-up? A. I'd have to see my note, but I think he was -- well recovering as expected. MR. LeNEAVE: Yeah. Josh, are you able to pull that up? 7/23. That's all right. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. My -- my notes suggest that he was experiencing some occasional shooting pains sometimes, making sleeping difficult, but otherwise doing pretty well. Does that sound about right? A. Yeah, if I remember right, his range of motion was about what I expected. He's had persistent shooting pains, which I think is secondary to his compartment syndrome issues, but, yes, that sounds about right. Q. Okay. And then I think the last time you saw him most recently, I guess, would have been on April 12th of 2022. MR. LeNEAVE: Can we pull that DR. ANDERSON: Yes. (Whereupon, there is simultaneous crosstalk.) DR. ANDERSON: That sounds correct. MR. LeNEAVE: All right. Can we pull that note up, Josh. Oh, boy. I don't have strong enough glasses. Can you make that any bigger? Oops. There you go. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. Does that help? A. I can see that. MR. LeNEAVE: Are you able to scroll down, Josh? BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. I assume, Doctor, you can't, like the rest of us cannot? A. Yeah, I cannot scroll on that. I -- I can see it. I can see him scrolling. But... Q. Okay. Are you able to read as we go through this? Here we go. A. I see April 12th, 2022, for the note. Q. Are you able to read that, or is that going too fast? A. If he -- he could scroll up to about half a page. Okay. I'm good. I can read that. Q. Okay. So what is the -- what is your assessment at -- at -- at that point? 4/12/22, you're about you're 12 months postsurgery. A. Yeah, so his range of motion is what I expect it at. I think it was down to -- I think it was 105 degrees of flexion. Most knee replacements I want to get to to 130 degrees of flexion, but considering his post-traumatic injury, 105 is pretty good for him. He was doing well with his normal life activities. That was kind of our goal. The range of motion was functional range. You know, when we talk about "functional range of motion," we're talking about being able to go up and down stairs, rise out of a chair, get out of a bathtub, those types of motions, which require at least 92 to 95 degrees of flexion. So at 105, they weren't what I wanted for a routine total knee, but for him I think that's very good and functional. Most of his activity is without without use of a cane. He had the remaining soft tissue sequelae with the occasional nerve pain and proprioception issues that I expected. I did not expect (Whereupon, there is simultaneous crosstalk.) DR. ANDERSON: --that get better, but, yeah. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. Describe that, the proprioception issues. What does that mean? A. So proprioception -- the -probably easiest way to think about that is how we feel our limb in space. So how we're able to have reaction forces to the ground when we're taking a step up, where -2 where -- where your strength and sensation of where that limb is and -- and whether or not it's gonna hold you up and -- and your trust in that limb as if you go to that next level with that. And so proprioception is kind of how -- again, how he feels his limb in space. And with his previous nerve injury, he has limitations with that. Q. Okay. And so what is the significance of that? A. It puts him at a fall risk. It -- it -- it means his limb function's not normal. It -it -- it is the sequelae of a previous soft tissue significant lower limb injury, and so at one year out which he's at -one year out from the knee surgery, which is a few years out now from his initial trauma. I think that's fairly plateaued as far as improvement. We expect improvement for those types of nerve injury within about the first 24 months. Usually most of it's in the first 12 months, depending on what the level of the injury was and what type of injury. And so, at this point out from his initial crush injury, I'd expect that to be fairly static at this point in time. Q. In other words, he's about as good as he's gonna get? A. I think so. MS. DALLON: Objection. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. All right. So you mentioned a couple of things in -- in the notes, and I think we've talked about them previously, but the --the residual -- residual sensory motor issues -- and those -- those relate back to the soft tissue, the -- the --the crush and the damage that -- that occurred as a result of the trauma? A. I would agree with that. Q. And the nerve pain is also something that was associated with that, that was addressed initially by Dr. Sojka's surgeries? MS. DALLON: Objection. Leading. DR. ANDERSON: I don't think the intent of Dr. Sojka's injury was -- I'm sorry, Dr. Sojka's surgery was to address the nerve injury itself. It was to prevent further nerve injury from the crush injury. So when somebody already has compartment syndrome, we're trying to prevent compartment syndrome, we already have the crush injury, we don't do surgery on that specific nerve unless it's lacerated, but to try to prevent future injury with that, if you -- you know, more -- more injury. So I can't comment specifically on what Sojka did during his surgery. I'd defer that to him. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. Okay. (Whereupon, there is simultaneous crosstalk.) DR. ANDERSON: Yeah. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. Is the nerve pain, to your knowledge or experience, Doctor -- is that impacted by the swelling, like, of a compartment syndrome? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And the proprioception you talked about a decreased agility was also in your note. And by that, what do you -- what do you mean to say? A. So depending on how you define "agility," but the ability for him to navigate through space -- so walking or doing fast turning motions, things that require, you know, mild athletic, moderate athletic activity -- those would be somewhat diminished for his reaction time and the strength as he was, you know, moving his body through space as it relates to that lower limb because the -- it's slightly weaker than a normal limb, and he also doesn't have the same sensation in that limb in addition to the fact he does have continued nerve pain, which can give a different feedback to the brain as far as how the limb is functioning. Q. All right. Now, I know you also had talked extensively about Mr. Walls's job, and you had recommendations concerning his return-to-work activities. Is that fair, Doctor? A. Yes. I've been educated in what his job is now with the papers from Union Pacific, and so I'm more familiar now with what that would entail. So, yes, I do have an opinion on that. Q. What is your opinion, Doctor? A. Based on the information of the job description from Union Pacific, I do not think he should be doing that particular job, base -- based on some of the strenuous activities that it appears to require. Q. And you're referring to the work described as a conductor-brakeman? A. Yes. That was the sheet that was given to me. Q. So specifically is --is a job that would require Mr. Walls to be walking extensively on rocks or uneven surfaces -- is that something that you think would be reasonable for him? A. I do not think he should be doing that on a recreational or on a job basis. Q. Why is that? A. He'll be a fall risk, and he could damage that joint, and the next fix is gonna be worse than what he has now. Q. Okay. And so why do you say that? A. If he was to fall and have a ligamentous injury, his medial lateral collateral ligament or a soft tissue injury, there's only as much real estate in that knee, and his soft tissue only tolerates so much, and so he has a good outcome now, but as a fall risk with that type of terrain, I would be very, very concerned that he could damage the implant, shorten the longevity of it, initially causing increased pain with the muscle forces required to dynamically stabilize his knee and that limb walking on rocks and the ballast, I think is what it's termed. Q. Yes. A. Walking on that, going up and down the steps -- I guess there's stairs, a ladder on the locomotive. The motion required for that, considering his motion limitation and the proprioception difference, moving between train cars and the -- and the proprioception and agility required for that -- I don't think he would meet those criteria on a sustained basis. Q. What about if a conductor -- or -- and an engineer may be required to carry knuckles? From time to time the knuckles, the couplers, on those trains will break, and those weigh upwards of 80 pounds, and they may be required to carry those, you know, some distances across the ballast to -- to get to -7 to the location where the knuckle broke. Is -- is that an activity that you would recommend for Mr. Walls? A. I would actually recommend against that. I would I would recommend he not even carry that on flat ground. Q. Okay. Why is that? A. Same reason. He -- the agility and the strength of his limb. On a single-leg stance, in order for him to walk with that, he eventually -- he has to go through the gait cycle, the gait phase, and the swing phase. And so as you swing your gait, you're going to a single-leg stance at one point in time. As he switches over to that limb with his weakness in that leg, I'd be worried about a fall and another injury. And so carrying 80 pounds like that for anything that requires a gait or twisting or pivoting puts his limb at risk of injury. And it's a --it's a real risk. And that's the thing. It's a real risk of a ligamentous injury if he was to fall. Q. Did you discuss those -- your concerns and -- and recommendations with Mr. Walls? A. Can you clarify that question more. That's a fairly general question. I need more specificity. Q. Yeah. Did -- did you tell -- in your conversation with Mr. Walls about his work activities, did you make it known that you -- to him -- that those are activities that he should avoid, that they're not safe for him and not in his best interest going forward? A. Yes, on multiple clinic visits, including our preoperative discussion. The preoperative discussion wasn't tailored specifically to the entire list on the Union Pacific documents -- I didn't have that at the time -- but he had described to me what he had done in a prior, and so we discussed it vaguely then, but I discussed it more in terms of general strenuous activity like I would any patient. Q. Sure. So you initially discussed it with Mr. Walls in -- in clinic, and then subsequently you were provided with a -- with a -- a job description from the railroad? A. Yes. Q. Was Mr. Walls's description orally to you -- was that generally consistent with what you saw from the Union Pacific? A. It didn't have quite the definition or detail, but, yes, it was in line with that. Q. Doctor, do you have an opinion -- because I'm gonna ask you a couple questions with respect to opinions you may hold in -- in this matter, and ask you to answer if you can to a reasonable degree of medical certainty. And if you can't, to -- to let me know. First off, do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of -- of medical certainty the diagnosis of injuries caused by the railroad incident that brings us here today? A. Yes. Q. And what is your opinion? A. So the initial -- I mean, the injury that I treated him for that I saw him for initially was post-traumatic -- severe post-traumatic knee arthritis with retained deep implants. Q. Okay. And do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to whether the care and treatment that Mr. Walls has received from you and to -- to the extent you're familiar with Dr. Sojka's care and treatment before he saw you -2 has that been reasonable and appropriate for the care of these injuries? A. Yes. Q. With regard to activity restrictions, I would assume they'd be the same for work as they would be at home? A. Yes. In general, yes. Q. Do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to what restrictions Mr. Walls should carry, both at work and at home, and whether those would be permanent in nature? A. Yes. I believe they would be permanent in nature barring some miracle where he develops more muscle strength in spite of his injuries. I do believe those -- those activities would be consistent as far as the level of -- of strain he would put on his joint between home and work. Q. So what would your recommendations be specifically in that regard? A. Avoid high-strain activities to his knee, avoid heavy lifting, avoid walking on uneven ground. I even talk to these patients about when they're mowing their lawn to, you know, not to be on uneven ground if they are mowing their lawn because they could step in a hole and fall. So that's fairly flat ground compared to ballasts. And I think it -3 his home environment won't be similar to a railroad track; so it's kind of a -I'm trying to think about how to answer your question because they're fairly different environments you're asking about. But, in general, I think you're asking about the stress level I'd let him put across his leg, and I'd advise patients in his situation to avoid high-strain activities like we've discussed. Q. Okay. Do you have an opinion as to Mr. Walls, given his age, his prognosis, and future care and treatment? A. Yes. I -I discussed with him that at his age there's a possibility for revision in the future due to implant failure. Based on the current literature I think we chose the right tibial component for him for very good longevity and much decreased risk of loosening of that tibial component. Femur components in general don't have as high of a loosening rate as tibial components do. So I think that those will kind of go hand in hand together. We then come to the polyethylene, and so I chose a vitamin-infused polyethylene, high molecular weight. I think it's one of the best options in the market, very highly resistant to third-body wear and very, very durable implant, and so I think he'll get good longevity out of this. But, again, if you look at the number of patients in their 40s who get total knee replacement and the evolution of those studies -you look at a 30-year outcome of those, that still puts us with the polyethylenes in literature that were made in the 1990s, and those are not comparable to today's because today's polyethylene should last longer. But we don't know yet, and so -- until we get to patients with years' history with these. In that age group my counseling is kind of based on the previous polyethylene, and so I have discussed with them "You could need this revised again. You could need a polyethylene exchange. You could need your components revised if they are to loosen over time." Which -- which is a very low likelihood, but it's still a likelihood. Q. And that's impacted by, certainly, his activity level? MS. DALLON: Objection. Leading. DR. ANDERSON: It can be -- yeah, so if you look at the literature on this, you look at the studies, some studies would support that higher impact activities over a 15-year period with modern polyethylenes have a similar outcome, but those are in patients who are the geriatric age, and so you have to decide as a reasonable physician or a researcher -- can you apply that to patients in their 40s? And so I counsel patients on that, say, "You know, these studies show that, yes, these can tolerate moderate activity like tennis, pickleball." That's what those studies look at. That's not really comparable what a 48-year-old would be doing with a manual labor job. And so I do have that discussion with them. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. Okay. If -- so to some extent, would the -- the likelihood of Mr. Walls requiring a further revision with, I guess, re-revision components -- would that be impacted by his decision going forward to -- to, you know, follow your recommendations and advice in terms of his activity levels at work and at home? A. Yes. I do think it does have a strong component of that. And I think the literature would support that as well. Q. What is the -- what does a revision knee replacement cost in today's dollars? A. You know, I don't have --MS. DALLON: Objection -2 Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me one second. Object as undisclosed. Go ahead. DR. ANDERSON: Yeah, I think HCA -a patient just asked this in the last couple weeks, and I want to say it was somewhere between 80,000 and 90,000 dollars was what the cost given to the patient was, the entire episode of care. That, of course, doesn't include insurance, you know, the way they do the insurance stuff and whatnot, what the patient actually pays. But I think the -- and now, I guess, these are published on HCA's transparency of -- of costs on the website. So I'd -I'd have -- I'd have to go look that up. But it was -- it's pretty expensive. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. What are the outcomes of re-revision total knee arthroplasties as compared to primary arthroplasties? A. Well, I just gave this talk last year in -at Flint Oak, the IC- -- International Conference of Joint Reconstruction. It was a re-revision total knee arthroplasty talk, and the outcome is not as good. They're a decreased range of motion; failure rate is higher; patient satisfaction tends to be less. It depends on what the reason for revision is, but as you go down, each subsequent knee surgery tends to have a lesser degree of patient satisfaction. And so if you look at the knee outcome scores -- the Knee Society outcome scores -- which we term the KOOS scores, the K-O-O-S. And we do a KOOS junior form, which is a published outcome measure. Those numbers decrease based on the reason for revision. So if it's a revision for infection, those -- those are much worse outcomes than a simple polyethylene swap for global instability. It just depends on what the reason for revision is. But, in general, the outcomes are worse depending on what the indication is. Q. Okay. Is one of your concerns about activity level related to the risk of infection? A. Activity level wouldn't -- should not have a bearing on infection. The multiple surgeries that he's had and the open wounds that he had from his compartment syndrome -- that -- that -that's really where the risks -- and the fact that he had deep implants in before prior to my surgery -- you know, we had those removed -that -- that's where the real risk. The multiply-operated-on knee is what raises his concern lifelong for infection. Q. Lifelong. Okay. A. Yeah, if you -- if you look at the pathologic specimens and how bacteria interact with the human body, they can become sequestered, or walled off, inside the body, and so there's different thoughts about the mechanism of how infection occurs; but with people who have previous multiple injuries, including open surgeries or open wounds around the time of surgery, such as a compartment syndrome we worry about retained bacteria that gets sequestered in the bone which can become dormant for a number of years and potentially become reactivated down the road. So that's always a concern if people become colonized but yet their immune systems are good enough to hold those infections in check until such times that it isn't in check anymore. Q. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Now, I want to turn your attention to a -- a report that was provided by a doctor that the railroad hired to review your notes and Dr. Sojka's notes and records, and to offer opinions in this case. Talking about Dr. Johnson. Have you reviewed his report? A. I have. Q. And seen his conclusions and his opinions? A. I have. Q. Do you agree with his opinions in this case? A. I --I don't -- I don't -- I think -- believe that the gist of his opinions were that the patient could return to work without restriction, if I --I'm kind -- I'm kind of boldly -- like, broadly summarizing that. Would that -9 (Whereupon, there is simultaneous crosstalk.) BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. Yeah. No, that's -- I think that's the focus that I'd like to address, is his conclusion or opinions that Mr. Walls should return to work with -- with no restrictions. Do you -- do you agree with that opinion? A. I do not agree with that opinion. Q. And why not? A. Mainly for the reasons we've discussed, and -- and to summarize in a nutshell, I would say the proprioception, his agility, and muscle strength put him at risk in a job that requires the -- the activities and the list that was provided by Union Pacific. Q. So -- so Dr. Johnson refers to some medical literature in his report that was to ostensibly support his opinions. Are you familiar with the literature? A. Yes. Q. Have you reviewed it? A. I have. Q. Does it support his opinions or his conclusions? A. I think it does the exact opposite. I think it supports my -- my opinions more so than his. Q. Can you explain that to us, please. A. Yeah. So I'm --I'm a reviewer for multiple journals, and so I spend a fair amount of time reviewing literature, and so I -- I critically reviewed those papers as I would any journal article I was reviewing. And if you read beyond the title and abstract and actually get into the paper, the materials and methods -- the exclusions, actually, was really interesting as far as the papers he chose to submit. If you actually read those papers and read the results, they would support my opinion about this patient's activity levels and outcomes more so than what I think Dr. Johnson was -- was hoping they would support. Q. And can you expound on that. A. So, for example, one -- one paper he looked at was the kneeling of the knee, and he tried to support that as activities for crawling. Kneeling is a static activity, and they were looking at, basically, do you damage the implants if you kneel on the knee. They weren't looking at the functional outcome, the duration of crawling. It was actually a fairly -- not well done paper for mechanical studies of the function of the patellar component on the knee. And so if you try to apply that to this particular patient, it's -it's apples and oranges. It wouldn't apply to this patient because it's a you're looking at a static activity versus a dynamic activity. And it sounds good if you look at the title, to support his -- his opinion, but if you actually read the paper, it doesn't support his opinion. Q. Is there anything about the articles that you reviewed that -that Dr. Johnson cited to that caused you to change your opinions in this case? A. No. Actually, again, it's fully supported, I think, what we're saying. If you look at, I think, three or four of the papers -- I'd have to pull up the the papers -- but they actually excluded patients with post-traumatic injuries, previous knee dislocations, previous open wounds, you know, people who had retained implants, previous surgeries. They excluded them from those studies, and they likely excluded those patients because of the exact reasons we have for Mr. Walls and that the outcomes are not applicable to routine knee arthritis. And so looking at those papers -- most of those papers are applicable to your routine, straightforward, geriatric generic knee arthritis patient. And that's not comparing a patient that --like Mr. Walls. They're not the same patient. And so and so most of the conclusions that were drawn from those papers, again, excluded patients in Mr. Walls's category because you can't apply those -- those -- those results to patients like Mr. Walls in general. And -- and so, no, it didn't change my opinion. I was somewhat incredulous that he submitted those papers. Q. Because they tended to submit your opinions A. I think if you read past the abstract and you actually read the papers and read more than just the title, that it -- that, yeah, they -- they support what -- what -- what I would say. Q. Dr. Anderson, did you find Mr. Walls to be a cooperative and an earnest patient? A. I found him to be a very compliant, reasonable patient. I spend a lot of time sitting down with my patients, particularly ones who have more complex issues, because it is -- it -- I'm in the middle of my career, and I've got some more longevity left in me; so I will follow this patient long-term, and so I try to really have a reasonable relationship. I do -- I did find him to be very reasonable and reasonable examinations. Q. And motivated to get better and cooperate with your recommendations and advice to -- to improving his health? A. Yeah, I -- I think he wants to get better. I I --I think he doesn't want to hurt, and I think he's had a very unfortunate injury, and -- and he's -- yeah, he's been very -- a reasonable patient who does want to get better. MR. LeNEAVE: Thank you, Dr. Anderson. That's all I have for you right now. BY MS. DALLON: Q. Good morning, Dr. Anderson. A. Good morning. Q. So when Mr. Walls came to see you first in January 2021, you certainly knew that he was a railroad worker; right? A. I --I --I -- I heard he was a railroad worker through Dr. Sojka, and then the patient also clarified that. Q. And he described to you his version of what had happened in his accident? A. Yes. Q. So you knew that he was working at a rail yard when his accident occurred? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And you did also learn in subsequent visits that he told you that he currently was off work because of his injury; right? A. I believe he told me he was unemployed at that time. Q. Okay. And so then, in April of 2021, you performed the surgery on him that you've been describing, and there was a follow-up visit six weeks after that surgery, which notes that he wasn't ready to return to work yet. Do you recall that? A. I would have to look at my exact wording of that, but I -- I typically see people back six weeks after surgery. Q. Okay. So do you -- do you recall noting that he wasn't ready to return to work yet? A. I don't recall noting that, but that is reasonable that I would have noted that. MS. DALLON: Okay. And let's see. Let's just look at what I will mark as Exhibit 105 -3 Defendant -- Defendant's Exhibit 105. (Whereupon, Exhibit 105, Christopher Walls's Progress Note, dated 5/25/21, was marked for identification.) BY MS. DALLON: Q. Okay. I'm gonna share my screen with you now. I'm showing you what we will mark as Defendant's Exhibit 105. Do you see that? A. Yes. Q. Okay. So this is your chart note from May 25th, 1, which was the six-weeks follow-up after the knee replacement surgery; is that right? A. That would be in the correct time frame, yes. Q. Okay. And I'm just gonna scroll down so that you can see the comment about returning to work, if I can find it. One moment. Okay. So do you see here on the first page, it says "... not medically stable to return to job with current activity limitations"? A. Yes. This is also my nurse practitioner's note, just -- I do see that. Yeah, that's Cara -- Cara Nuss, my nurse practitioner. I would have seen the patient the same day as long as I was still in --I was in clinic, I would have stopped in and seen him. It should be noted in the bottom. Yeah, right there. But, yeah, that's my nurse practitioner's note. Q. Right. And -- and like you said, it is noted at the bottom that you did enter the room and participate in this -- in this visit; correct? A. Yes. Q. Okay. So you -- you talked about -- I'm gonna stop sharing this one. You -- you talked a little bit earlier in your testimony about discussing goals and expectations with Mr. Walls before his knee replacement surgery. Did any of those discussions have to do with his goals or expectations with respect to any kind of work? A. Yeah, I --I --yeah -- yes. Because he had brought up the unemployment -- and his wife comes with him most visits -- we had discussed, you know, meaning -- meaningful life after an injury like this, and we typically discussed employment. We didn't discuss specific employment, but -- but certainly goals for returning to gainful employment at -- at the time of those -- at those visits -2 multiple visits, is typically what we discuss. Q. But he didn't tell you that one of his goals was to return to his old job at Union Pacific? A. I don't recall that. MS. DALLON: Okay. So after the May 25th visit that we just looked at, you saw him again on July 23rd, 2021. And I'm going to try to get that visit up for you. We'll mark this as Exhibit -- Defendant's Exhibit 103. And I'm gonna share my screen now. (Whereupon, Exhibit 103, Christopher Wall's Progress Note, dated 7/23/21, was marked for identification.) BY MS. DALLON: Q. Okay. I'm showing you what we will mark as Defendant's Exhibit 103. Do you recognize this as your July 23rd, 2021, chart note? A. Yes. Q. And at this point Mr. Walls was about two months out from surgery; correct? A. April to -- so that would be about three months. Q. Three months. Thank you. Okay. Okay. And I'm showing you what I think is the second page of the chart note. I'll go back up just to make sure. Okay. Yes, this is the second page of the chart note. And if you can see my cursor, this is -- this is your note here: "Although they no longer have restrictions and may continue with weightbearing as tolerated, we discussed the need for dental prophylaxis and refrain from any activity that hurts or feels funny." That's your -- that's your chart note; right A. That's correct. Q. -- Dr. Anderson? A. That is correct. Q. And do you recall -- in that discussion with Mr. Walls, did he object to your description of the limitations on his activities during that visit? A. So, no, there were no -- so to answer your question, no, there were no objections to that phrase of of -- so the phrase I say to patients is "Don't do it if it hurts or feels funny," and there were no objections to that. I can't recall our specific discussion, but, in -- in general, there were no objections to that. Q. Okay. Thank you. So you answered some questions in response to Mr. LeNeave about your understanding of Mr. Walls's former job duties, and there was some discussion about carrying a knuckle. What is a "knuckle"? A. A --I believe that's the -- I believe that's the piece that goes between the two trains that couples the trains together. Q. And how often would Mr. Walls have to handle a knuckle if he were to return to work? A. My understanding was that's a fairly common thing when putting trains together. So if he's in the train yard or one breaks on the tracks, it is which I don't know how frequently that is; it's not my area, but -- but it -- but it sounded, based on discussions -- I think we discussed this at the last deposition that -- that it was -- it was -- it was a fairly common occurrence. I don't know what that number means, but I think you introduced me to that -- that topic. Q. And by "fairly common occurrence," do you mean something like that once per shift? A. I have no idea what that --what that would mean as far as how often that occurs. Q. And how about how far Mr. Walls would have to carry a knuckle? A. Well, the way it was described to me was at least between cars, and so whatever the length of a normal train car is. I don't know where they store those knuckles as far as where they have to carry them or even if it's up the grade of -- of the ballast. So I --I --I haven't actually gone to the train yard and witnessed this, but kind of what's been described to me through the -- these depositions is that sheet of paper those -- that -- that -- that description that was sent to me -- I don't recall if it says the actual -- actual length that he has to carry them. Q. Did you ask Mr. Walls about this particular activity? A. I did. That's -- that's where I -- I think I learned it was a -- the device that couples. I but that's a --that's a vague recollection. Q. And you talked about Mr. Walls having to move between train cars. Under what conditions do you understand he would have to move between train cars if he came back to work for Union Pacific? A. My understanding was that it was at slow speeds in the train yards, that sometimes they will go between one or two train cars. I'm not sure of the exact purpose and what occurs once that activity's completed, but my understanding was it was under slow speed, not -- not high speed. But -- but those cars can jolt occasionally as they stop, and the way it was kind of described to me was that it was a stable -- an unsteady base upon which he would be moving from car to car be- -- because it --it --it does have some motion, if I'm -- if I'm correct on that. Q. Okay. So are you describing Mr. Walls actually crossing between cars by climbing on the equipment? A. I don't -- I don't know the exact -- I don't -- I don't know the exact -- but, yeah, if you're moving between cars, I suppose if you label the --the train cars as "equipment," the way it was described to me was patient -- I'm sorry, that the --they will move between train cars occasionally. So I I don't know if we're getting into semantics here. I --I --I don't -- I don't know. Q. Follow up on that. By "occasionally," do you have any idea how often you believe Mr. Walls would have to do that activity if he were to return to work? A. It sounded like a routine part of the job. Q. And you also mentioned climbing ladders. Do you have any knowledge about how -- how steep the steps are of the ladders that you're talking about? A. Yeah, so the way it was described to me was on the -- going from the ballast on the tracks up into the train, it was a fairly steep, not 90-degree, but maybe slightly inclined ladder. And the --the steps required at least 90 degrees of knee flexion with single-leg stance to go up there. I don't know how many steps it takes, how tall those ladders are. Having seen trains before, I imagine it's five or six, but I don't -- I don't know. Q. Okay. In your most recent visit with Mr. Walls in April of this year, you did note that he could climb stairs one to one; is that right? A. Yeah. That's like household steps. Q. Okay. And does "one to one" mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot? Is that what you meant by that? As opposed to the way sometimes children climb stairs where they get both feet on and then go to the next one? A. So --so I -- I think of that in terms of geriatric. But, yeah, it means alternating steps, but for me, a geriatric patient with a bad limb would take their good leg up first and then bring the back leg up behind them to go two on one, and so single step at a time versus alternating steps. Q. Okay. So -- so he can do that okay. And you don't restrict him from doing that in a -- in a household setting; right? A. There's no restrictions, but, again, if it -- if it hurts or feels funny, he's to go back to the most stable activity position, which -- which -- whatever that -- whether that's use of a cane or use of the handrail. Yeah. Q. Okay. Well, let's talk about the rock for a minute. What's your understanding of how big the rock is that Mr. Walls would be walking on if he came back to work? A. Yeah, I think it's -- the ballast -- I think it was described to me as being anywhere from, like, two to four inches packed up against the -- the -- the the berm that kind of goes up into the -- the rails. And so it's not a --it's a loose -- loose rock, two to four inches is the way I think it was described to me. Q. And how far would he have to walk on that rock if he were to come back to work? A. I --I don't know that answer. I know, you know, looking at train tracks, it's --it's -- depending on what --what -- how much ballast it has would would vary on that answer. Q. And how often would he have to be walking on ballast? A. My understanding is that was a fairly routine part of the job. Q. And you understand that from the job description that you received from Union Pacific's records? A. That and the last deposition we did, somebody described that to me in the last deposition, if I recall correctly. Q. Okay. Mr. Walls's -- one of Mr. Walls's attorneys? A. It was either one of his attorneys, or it may have been you. I'm not sure. Q. Okay. So you mentioned that you haven't been able to go out to the rail yard and observe conditions in which employees who do Mr. Walls's job work. Have you seen any photos? A. I've actually been to rail yards. My -- I grew up -- my -- my dad's a massive train fan; so we've actually ridden on steam trains before, and I've I've walked the tracks when I was -- when I was a child, but I have not watched employees with a specific mission of studying their -- their movements. But I have -- I have been to railroad yards before. Q. Have you seen any photos that have been provided to you to help you understand what Ms. --Mr. Walls's job duties would be if he returned to work? A. Not photos specific to that, no. I've not had anything specifically given to me for Mr. Walls. Q. What about videos? A. No. Q. Just the last area I wanted to talk to you about -7 well, actually, before that, are you confident that you know what activity restrictions should be placed on Mr. Walls? A. Yes. Q. So you're confident in your restrictions, and he doesn't need to go to another physician to get a second opinion or to be evaluated for the -- for possible other restrictions; is that right? A. Well, I think that'd be at least a third or fourth opinion at that point in time because -- but, no, I think that any -- most reasonable fellowship-trained joint surgeons with the knowledge that I've gotten from this particular patient, this particular case would probably have fairly similar expectations, particularly if they are familiar with young patients who have knee replacements. Q. Okay. And so the last question I want to ask you you talked about the -- the studies that Mr. -- that Dr. Johnson relies upon in his report, but you haven't given any additional studies -2 (Whereupon, there is simultaneous crosstalk.) BY MS. DALLON: Q. -- to support this case; right? A. Yeah, I was never asked to provide any studies. MS. DALLON: Okay. Just checking. Thank you very much, Dr. Anderson. That's all the questions I have. MR. LeNEAVE: Doctor, I'd like to show you what we've marked as Exhibit 27. (Whereupon, Exhibit 27, UP Trainman Job Description Brief, was referenced for questioning.) BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. It's a --it's a job description -- a Union Pacific Railroad trainman, brakeman, switchman, conductor job description. A. Okay. Q. I believe you've been provided this in the past, and you referred to it earlier in your testimony. Am I correct? A. Yes. Q. And we don't need to go through everything here, but if we just kind of scroll down in the essential job functions and down to the third paragraph -5 "Conduct Train" equipment -- "Train and Equipment Inspections." Do you see that? A. Yes. Q. And where it talks on walking on ballast, do you understand that to be the rocks that support the rail -- the track bed? A. Yes, sir. Q. And ground the length of a train to distances of over a mile. Let me just stop right there. Is that the kind of job you would want Mr. Walls back in? A. No. Q. Why not? A. Walking on the ballast, because of the instability of ballast, particularly on the grading, depending what the grade of the ballast is -- and by that, I mean how steep it is -- and then the length of over a mile. Q. Do you see -- we can -- we can back up a little bit, I think, and talk about switching operations, pulling a pin lifter -- which is a --MR. LeNEAVE: Go back down there. Right there, I think. BY MR. LeNEAVE: Q. Would you want Mr. Walls to be walking alongside a moving train on the ballast, holding a pin lifter, getting ready to raise it or drop it to dis- -- to disconnect railcars? A. So I don't know exactly what the pin lifter rod is; I can imagine. But just walking along the moving cars on ballast alone -- the answer to that would be no. Q. Bad idea? A. I think it's a bad idea. Q. You see moving up -- "Moving replacement knuckle to location of broken knuckle; remove and replace broken knuckle; align drawbars" -- well, let's stop with the knuckle. Assuming it weighs 70 or 80 pounds, is that something you want Mr. Walls doing? A. Again, I wouldn't want him carrying that much on a flat surface, much less the instability that could be provided -- the concern for that walking on the ballast. Q. Now, Doctor, do you need to see any photos or videos to determine that Mr. Walls shouldn't be walking on uneven ground or ballast or rocks? A. I think I'm familiar enough with train tracks to -3 I don't need to see pictures unless you'd like to provide them. Q. On July 23rd of 2021, were you recommending to Mr. Walls that he return to work at the railroad as a conductor or trainman? A. No. MR. LeNEAVE: Thank you, Doctor. MR. EKLUND: Are there any further questions? Should I conclude the deposition? MR. LeNEAVE: I have no further questions. MS. DALLON: No further questions. (Whereupon, the court reporter requests transcript order details.) MR. LeNEAVE: I'll take an --an e-tran and the video. And, Doctor, you're free to go now. Thank you very much. DR. ANDERSON: Thank you. MS. DALLON: Thank you very much, Dr. Anderson. E-tran, please. But I do not need the video. MR. EKLUND: Okay. Thank you. This concludes
