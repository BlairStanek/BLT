A. It was approximately a month and a halfago, maybe. Q. Do you recall what matter that was in? A. Not specifically. I think it may have been in a Progressive matter, but I don't recall. Q. Do you know where the action was pending? A. I do not. Q. Do you know if it was in Florida? A. I don't know. Q. Okay. I'm going to skip through some of my, you know, preamble because you've had your deposition taken a number of times. So, did you spend time preparing for this deposition?A. Yes. Q. And how long did you spend preparing for this deposition? A. Roughly three or four hours. Q. And what did you do in preparation for this deposition? A. I reviewed the notices that were provided to me, some of the moving papers in the case, components of the complaint. I reviewed the electronic claims data for the named beneficiary here, and I reviewed some documents that were produced by the defendants.Q. Do you know what documents that were produced by the defendants that you reviewed? A. I believe that there were medical records associated to the B.W. claim. Q. Do you recall the medical -- the specific medical records that you reviewed? A. It was a large stack, I guess. Q. Did you review any medical records that had to -- that related to the underlying services which form the bases of the complaint in this action? A. I'm sorry. Could you rephrase the question? Q. Sure. Did any of the medical records that you reviewed relate to the claims that underlie the claims made in the complaint? A. I don't specifically recall. I believe they may have. I recall, as I was reviewing them, that nothing was inconsistent with the medical claims data that was provided by plaintiff for the B.W. claim. Q. When you say "wasn't inconsistent" what do you mean by that? A. There was nothing different about those medical records than what I saw in the medical claims data.Q. Okay. Did you see any medical records that were the medical invoices for the claims that were asserted in the complaint? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't specifically recall. I think there may have been some transaction history in there. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. What do you mean by "transaction history"? A. There may have been medical records that pertain to diagnostic codes for some of the services that we saw in the medical claims data. Q. Were any of those diagnostic codes related to the services that the complaint says State Farm didn't pay for? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I believe so. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Do you recall what those were? A. Not specifically. Q. Do you recall what body part they referred to? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. Not specifically. I'm sorry. I was -the notice called for me to prepare for broader data questions. It's my understanding that there's a deposition scheduled for our chief medical officer, who I'm sure can answer those specific questions. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. I'm just asking you what you know. And that's not argumentative. I'm just telling you, if you don't know, you can say, "I don't know," which you've done a few times, which is fine, too.A. Yeah. Q. Was there anything that was remarkable about finding those diagnosis codes in the records that you reviewed? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I wouldn't say there was anything remarkable about them. Q. Okay. Other than reviewing the documents which you detailed for us, did you meet with anybody regarding preparing for the deposition today? A. Yes. Q. Who did you meet with? A. I met with my attorneys, one of which is in the room, and that was it. Q. How long -- well, who else was in the meeting with you and your attorney? I guess you're referring to Jordan? A. Yes. In the meeting there was also Manny Gonzalez Brito for a brief time, who is the medical officer here at MSP Recovery, LLC. Q. Anybody else? A. That's all. Q. Is Mr. Brito a lawyer? A. No. Q. You're a lawyer, right? A. Yes. Q. How long did you meet with Jordan and Mr. Brito? A. I believe it was roughly two hours or an hour and a half that I was there with them. Q. When was that? A. That was yesterday, Wednesday. Q. Okay. MR. PENNEKAMP: Jordan, no offense by using your first name. If you tell me how to pronounce your last name, I'm happy to do that, too.MR. MACEJKA: Jordan's fine, but it's Macejka, in case you ever --MR. PENNEKAMP: Macejka, and I apologize. I know you've told me that before. MR. MACEJKA: No worries. MR. PENNEKAMP: I'll try and make that happen. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Other than that meeting, did you meet with anybody else in preparation for the deposition testimony that you're -A. No. Q. -- giving here today? Sorry. A. No. Q. Are you presently employed? A. Yes. Q. Who are you employed by? A. MSP Recovery, LLC. Q. When did you -- when were you first employed by MSP Recovery, LLC? A. 2018. I believe it was around June or July. MR. PENNEKAMP: You have frozen on my screen. I don't know if anybody else -THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the record. The time is 12 -- 2:15. End of Media 1. (Recess 2:15 p.m. until 2:15 p.m.) THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record at 2:15, Media 2. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. I apologize. I'm going to ask it again, only because I'm not sure if I heard an answer. When did you become employed by MSP Recovery, LLC?A. It was roughly June or July of 2018. Q. Have you been employed by MSP Recovery, LLC, continuously ever since? A. Yes. Q. Are you employed by any other entity? A. No. Q. Are you paid an annual salary by any other entity since 2018? A. No. Q. Have you received any other benefits since 2018 related to MSP? I'm not asking about outside of the MSP realm like from like a trust account or something, but just MSP-related entities. MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I'm sorry. Could you define what you mean by benefits? BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. What I mean by what? A. Benefits. Q. Benefits. Have you been paid, whether it's a salary or a bonus or a distribution by any other MSP-related entities other than MSP Recovery, LLC, since June or July of 2018? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. No. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Okay. What is your present job duty and responsibility at MSP Recovery, LLC? A. My title is chief information officer. I generally oversee the processes that are conducted involving the ingestion of data, its storage, the analysis of data. I lead research and development, and I oversee and coordinate and liaison between the different departments. Q. Okay. Are -- what are the different departments? A. There's research and development, which I lead directly, and then there's the -- generally, the IT department. Those are the programmers and developers that work on our technology. And then there's the accounting department. Q. Okay. How many folks are in the research and development department? A. There's roughly eight or nine individuals. Q. How about in the IT department? A. Thirty; 30, 35. Q. And in the accounting department? How many people are in the accounting department? I should say that. A. Five to seven, I believe. Q. So you're responsible for the ingestion of data; is that correct? Is that what you said earlier? A. I oversee the processes. I act as records custodian, so I oversee the flow, intake of data, how it's ingested, how it's displayed in the MSP system and the analysis that we do with it. Q. Who actually does the -- I'm using your term -- ingestion? A. The ingestion is done through an SFTP portal. It is generally an automated transaction between the assignors and the MSP system. Q. So there's no -- is there an individual there pressing buttons saying, yes, go get that -we're going to collect this -- we're going to ingest this information? A. At certain points, there may be individuals involved with setting a process to run that will ingest the data, but there's no one in particular going and getting the data, if that makes sense. Q. Is that because it's -- after the first ingestion, it's automated after that? A. Even at the first injection -ingestion -- excuse me -- it is typically loaded onto a SFTP and then brought into our S3 buckets on our environment almost automatically. Q. So it's uploaded from the assignor to an SFTP portal; is that accurate? A. Yes. Q. You don't oversee that process, do you? A. Oversee that process, no. Q. Okay. But then you oversee the process of ingesting it from the SFTP portal into the MSP system. Is that -- what's the proper terminology? A. That's the correct terminology. Yes, I oversee that process. Q. Who maintains the MSP system? A. The MSP system is maintained by MSP Recovery, LLC. Q. Who specifically maintains the system? A. I don't know that there's any one individual. Members of the IT team are responsible for certain aspects of the MSP system. It's a predominantly cloud-hosted environment on AWS. Q. Okay. And so all of MSP Recovery, LLC's, data is held in AWS cloud-based storage; is that accurate? A. Yes. Q. Okay. Do you know -- is it one location? A. It's not a physical location. Cloud-based storage is disbursed amongst the servers that are maintained by AWS. Q. Is it segregated by the assignors? A. We do maintain different segmented data sets for each assignor, yes. Q. How many assignor -- how many assignors-strike that. You -- did I understand what you just said correctly, is that there's separate databases for each assignor in your AWS storage?A. We do maintain assignor data segregated in its own environment on our AWS cloud environment, yes. Q. That's what I was looking for, the word "environment." So I didn't step on myself or try not to. How many different environments does MSP Recovery, LLC, maintain at the moment?A. We have data from over roughly 162 different assignors. Q. Okay. In addition to the 162 assignors, are there any other databases that MSP Recovery, LLC, maintains on its AWS environment? A. As far as databases, there are other databases. Most of them are third-party sources or resources of information. So we do have a database and logs of information from CMS's HETS, H-E-T-S, database that internally we refer to as "Ability." We also have databases for crash reports. We have access to that in Florida, Georgia and parts of Ohio. That's coming from the Department of Motor Vehicles, and there's a slew of other databases that are not really relevant to this case, such as our Medi-Span database, which has information about drugs and FDA components. Q. Okay. You mentioned -- there were some initials -- I'm sorry I didn't catch them, but the CMS database that you referred to, what are those? You said CMS and then you gave a few letters, and then you said, "We refer to it as Ability." A. The HETS database. That is how we access MMSEA, M-M-S-E-A, Section 111, reporting.Q. So is that one environment that you're referring to, the CMS environment? A. Well, it's all a collective environment. They're segmented databases on our AWS environment. Q. What do you mean by "segmented databases"? A. They're partitioned or separate. Q. How do you decide how to partition or separate it? A. Every data set gets its own partitioning. Q. Right. So if I understand what you said earlier -- I'm not -- again, tell me where I'm wrong. If I understand what you said earlier, there's approximately 162 assignors that each have their own environment in your AWS environment. And when I say "your" I mean MSP Recovery, LLC's, environment. Is that correct? A. It is -- I would consider it one environment. It is segmented by each assignor or data set. Q. Okay. That would be 162, approximately, for the number of assignors that you have? And when you say "assignors," is that MAOs or MAs? A. That is Medicare Advantage Organizations and MA plans generally, as well as some other --other entities like commercial entities and hospitals and providers.Q. Okay. And then, in addition to those, the MAOs, the MAs, the commercial and the hospitals, you also have a some other third-party source environments that are segmented, correct; and we went through those? A. Yes. Q. The first one that you mentioned was CMS MMSEA 111 Reporting; is that correct? A. It is CMS's HETS database. H-E-T-S. That is where we access the MMSEA 111 reporting. Q. Okay. You also mentioned that you have a separate segmented crash environment that, I guess there would be separate ones for Florida, Georgia and parts of Ohio; is that accurate? A. Yep, I would -- yes. I would refer to them as a different data sets. Collectively, it's one environment. It's just a segmented environment. Q. Okay. The same is true for Medi-Span and FDA, and then you mentioned that there were plenty of others that aren't relevant to this litigation; is that accurate? A. Yes. Q. Okay. Give me just -- I'm not going to go -- if it's irrelevant, I'm going to try to skip over it. But just give me some ideas of the other segmented areas that you say are irrelevant to this litigation. Give me an idea.MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. They would just be lookup tables that are relevant to commercial assignors or information like that. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. On -- when you are going to set up a segmented area on the AWS servers for a new assignor, what's the process? A. Generally, when were engaging with an assignor, the first step is going to be to set up the SFTP. That is their portal to provide us with data and information. When that is to be ingested, an environment is created -- a set of folders is created internally, and that data is loaded on there. And it is logged and kept in there and kept as a kind of a golden lock box or purer version of what was received. From there a copy of that data set will be ingested into the MSP system, normalized and processed for our use.Q. Okay. You mentioned that a set of folders is set up in the SFTP. What are those folders?A. Those folders are like the File Explorer on your computer. It's just essentially a folder where the assignor can put their data. Q. Is it just one folder, or are there separate folders for different data coming in from the assignor? A. That depends on the engagement with the assignor. In some context there may be several folders set up. Q. What -- give me some examples of what separate folders would look like or be. A. There may be situations where an assignor services multiple lines of business. So they may have commercial -- commercial line, and we would generally put that in its own folder, segmented from their Medicare or Medicaid lines. Q. Okay. Generally speaking, is the Medicare line placed from an MAO that you're ingesting placed into a single folder in SFTP? A. Generally each transfer will be under a folder. There may be its own subfolder inside of that, depending on how they elect to transfer to us the data. But generally it is under one master folder. Q. Okay. And the folder that the documents from the MAO -- sorry. The data from the MAO is -MA or MAO is placed in, you mentioned that at least the original set, does it stay in SFTP? A. No. It's loaded into our environment and maintained there. Q. Okay. That's the -- I'm just using your terminology -- into some sort of a golden lock box or an area, I guess, that means cannot be tampered with; is that accurate? A. Yes. Q. Who has access to the golden lock box? A. Certain members in the ingestion process that are in the IT department. Q. Is it more than one person? A. I believe it's just one person. I would have to check on that. Q. Who's the person? A. It's our IT director. His name is George Santana. Q. How long has Mr. Santana -- well, is Mr. Santana employed by MSP Recovery, LLC? A. Yes. Q. Do you know how long he's been employed by MSP Recovery, LLC? A. Since that company's inception. Q. That inception was in 2014, '15? A. I believe so, yes. Q. And then you mentioned that original data is, I guess, duplicated and moved into a different environment -- a different segregated environment; is that accurate? A. It's moved into a pipeline, which is a flow of algorithms and queries and programming that brings it into essentially the MSP system and follows certain normalization and preparation steps. Q. Okay. So at that point, is the second set of data that's received from the -- strike that. Is it that point at which the duplicated data received from the MAO or MA now not segregated according to the MAO?A. When it goes to the end of that pipeline or process, it is available to be part of analytics that would draw on all of our assignor's information. Q. So is it commingled with the other data that's received from other MAOs and MAs on the MSP system? A. I wouldn't say it's commingled, but it is available for whatever analytics would be necessary. So certain queries can be run. Those queries can reference the client databases, in which case that query then will pull from all of those different data sets.Q. Okay. Is the same true of the CMS, Crash Medi-Span, FDA? A. Generally, yes. Q. Are -- is the data that is ingested from the MAOs updated? A. There are, in many cases, subsequent transfers of data. In some cases, they may have adjustments to lines that we received in a previous transfer. Q. You mean changes in lines -- what do you mean by that? A. I don't think the -- I've never seen a line change, but there could be a subsequent adjustment or some accounting treatment of a line that we saw in a previous batch. Q. Define for me what you mean by line. Are we talking about -- well, define for me what you mean by line. MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. In this context I'm referring to a claim line. So typically it is a -- we can think of it as a row on an Excel table, and that row will correspond to a date of service. There will be a CPT code and several diagnostic codes on it, or it will be for pharmacy treatment. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. How will that change, that line change? A. If there is an adjustment, we won't see that particular line change. We'll see in a new transfer an additional line added to the sequence, which will have the same date of service, the same CPT code, the same diagnostic code, and whatever modification would have been made. Q. What does that change tell you? A. That's contextual. It depends. It will be evident what the change is. I don't think that that is something we've seen here on any of the lines presented for B.W. Q. Okay. What's the mission statement of MSP Recovery, LLC? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I do not recall the mission statement off the top of my head. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Do you know generally what it is? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. I don't want to guess, no. Q. So, as you sit here today, the company you've worked for for awhile, 2018, you don't know what their mission is? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I'm sorry. If you're referring to a specific mission statement that may be part of website or other things, I don't know it verbatim. I don't want to guess what it might state, if that's what you're referring to. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Well, I am. I just want to know what your company's primary mission is, MSP Recovery, LLC? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Again, is this -Q. If you don't know, it's fine. It's not a big deal. Do you focus on data analytics? Sorry Chris -- Mr. Miranda. MR. MACEJKA: Can you repeat that question, Mike? MR. PENNEKAMP: Yeah. Sorry about that. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Do you focus on data and analytics? A. Yes. Q. Is there a particular industry that you focus on within the data and analytics?A. We focus on health care data. Q. What organizations within health care do you focus on? A. Well, we cover the full panoply of the health care organizations. We primarily and traditionally focus on Medicare Advantage Organizations or the Medicare space generally, actually. Q. What is the difference between Medicare and Medicaid and commercial health insurer? A. Medicare and Medicaid are government programs. Medicare is a government program of right. Medicaid is a government program of need. Commercial lines are obviously commercial -commercially available insurance -- health insurance. Q. Sort of going back to the databases and segregation, does the -- does the MA or MAO transfer all of their data or just selected data that they have? A. Typically it amounts to basically all of their data or at least most of it. Sometimes a particular assignment will have a range of years for which data was transferred. So, obviously, the data that's transferred will be the medical claims data commensurate with that span of time.Q. It may be limited by the year of the data. But as far as you're aware, the MAs and MAOs transfer all of their data that they have relating to the claims? A. I would say that they transfer all of their claims data relating to the claims. There may be -- they may have their own third-party data sets that they won't don't transfer along with them, that just are not relevant to the claims data. Q. What do you mean by third-party data sets in the context of what you just testified? A. I imagine an assignor could maintain something similar to what we have with Medi-Span just on their own side for their own references purposes, but they don't give us that. They only give us the actual medical claims data. Q. Well, what do you -- we didn't go into that. What are you referring to that you have for Medi-Span? A. We did talk about that. Medi-Span has the drugs information and FDA information on prescription drugs and NBCs. Q. If a MAO or MA has medical records and medical invoices on CMS-1500 forms or UB forms, do they transfer those images to MSP Recovery, LLC? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Well, in some instances we have received essentially PDF or image versions of the billing. That is very, very rare. I think less than -- less than ten percent of all medical transactions even happen that way on a CMS-1500 or UB-04 paper form. Predominantly the data that we receive is the electronic data commensurate with EDI transfer. So it's going to be 835 or 837 format. That's the electronic standard and predominantly how electronic records are sent. So in that context, there is no CMS-1500 or UB-04 form generated for them to send it to us. In very limited circumstances from some assignors we've received image versions of those forms.Q. Thank you. Do you know, as you sit here today, if the MAOs received the medical records and 1500s and UB-04s? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. They may be in receipt of medical records if they request them. My understanding is that they do not, as part of the normal practice, receive UB-04 and CMS-1500 forms. CMS mandates that records be transmitted through the EDI, which make them 835, 837 formatted electronic files.Q. Is it your testimony that an MAO has to request medical records in order to receive them? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. They would have to request them, yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Okay. You mentioned that in -- I think you said less than ten percent would have 15 -CMS-1500 or UB-04 forms; is that accurate? A. In paper, yes. I actually believe that that statistic is inflated -- that ten percent is inflated, because it's mostly the auto industry that's still using those paper forms. Q. When you say "paper forms," are you referring to actual paper, or are you referring to PDFs or images of paper? A. Paper or PDF images, yeah. Q. Have you ever asked an MAO to transfer whatever images they have of medical records or invoices? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I want to be clear, I'm drawing a distinction between medical records and those invoices. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Let's do them separately, then. A. Yeah. Q. Have you -- have you, MSP Recovery, ever asked an MA or an MAO to transfer medical records at the same time that they transfer the medical data that you're referring to? A. We have had those conversations. Q. Okay. And did they? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. They transferred whatever they had collected. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Do you know if they didn't transfer other data or images that they had in their possession? A. I'm sorry. Could you rephrase the question? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Yeah. Who determines what they transfer to you? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. The content of what's transferred will either be dictated by the assignment, by matter of that document kind of being a contract. We will have kind of extensive conversations with them about the claims data and what they maintain and how best to transfer that information. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. So when you have these discussions with them about what they maintain, I would imagine the subject of -- well, let me ask the question. Does the subject of medical records, either in paper or image form, arise? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. We have had those conversations. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Okay. And when you learned -- when -"you" being MSP Recovery, LLC -- learn that the MAO has paper or image form medical records, does MSP Recovery, LLC, request that from the MAO or MA? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. In that context we request that everything that's available be transferred with the data. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. What assignees -- sorry -assignors do you have physical documents, medical records or images for? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Specifically with regards to medical records, I don't believe that any assignor has provided them. I do believe that in some context they've made available their process for obtaining them. So they have relationships with certain providers, so when they have to request those medical records they've made that process available to us, should we need it.Q. Have you ever taken them up on that and used the process to obtain medical records? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. In the limited context where it's available, yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. You have? A. Yes. Q. Do you remember -- do you specifically recall when that was? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I do not specifically recall. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Do you specifically recall what assignor that related to? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't specifically recall. I'd have to look that up. Q. The same questions but with regard to the medical invoices, since we split them up. MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Where they're received and that documentation is maintained by the assignor, we've requested that it be transferred. Q. Have you received it? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. Yes. Q. Where is it maintained? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. In the same environment as the claims data. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Has -- in particular this case, the B.W. matter, did AvMed provide the medical invoices as part of their data transfer in the form of documents or images? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. The medical claims data was provided in electronic format, which is the format that it was maintained by the assignor. I do not believe that there were any images that accompanied it. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Were those -- were any images that were available from AvMed, were they requested? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. They would have been requested, yes. Q. Did you receive any? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. Not to my knowledge. Q. Is there a place on MSP's environment that you can go and check? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Where would I check if I were looking? Tell me how I would check. MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Essentially, we would look in that golden lock box for things that were not structured as medical claims data. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Have you -- have you looked in that golden lock box for any such documents relating to B.W.'s claim? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Not particular to the B.W. claim. But I am familiar with the data that was transferred by AvMed, the assignor in this context, and to my knowledge, there were no image files or PDFs. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. When was the last time that you reviewed the data or whatever you received from AvMed pursuant to this particular assignment agreement that's at issue in this lawsuit? MR. MACEJKA: Form.A. This morning. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. You went into the golden lock box? A. No. Q. Oh. How did you check it, then? A. I reviewed the records for what was received by this assignor in its categorization. Q. Can you explain that to a layperson like myself? What do you mean by that? A. We keep a log of what was received. Q. Uh-huh. A. I reviewed that log. Q. Okay. Where is the log maintained? A. On the MSP system. Q. What is contained on the log, what data fields are on the log? A. The log lists what was received by the assignor and when, and in what matter. Q. Okay. So what was received? A. Medical claims data. Q. Would the log show if any PDFs were received? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. How would it show you that? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. It would be marked or denoted as being not a medical claims data file, and it would be shown as a different type of file. Q. Okay. You didn't see any of that on the claim log? A. No. Q. Do you have emails or any communications between MSP Recovery and AvMed relating to the data requested to be transferred pursuant to the assignment? A. I don't know. I'd have to review. Q. Do you remember, as you sit here today, if AvMed determined what data would be transferred or if MSP Recovery, LLC, determined what data would be transferred? A. The data transferred, that decision would have been made after our conversation between the two parties.Obviously, MSP Recovery, LLC, doesn't have unlimited access to AvMed's data. Their technicians or their IT department would have made the decision what was in compliance with the request.Q. As you sit here today, you don't know -I'm asking. Do -- as you sit here today, do you know what data is on AvMed's system? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I know that there's medical claims data in their system, because that is what we're in receipt of. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Right. But you don't know if they have more data, do you? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. No. They may. That's -- we kind of touched on this. I'm sure there's other third-party databases that they have and other information that wasn't part of the transfer. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. And you -- being MSP Recovery, LLC -didn't request any additional data or information or documentation other than what you have in your log; is that correct?A. We would have requested claims data in whatever form it would be maintained by the assignor. And in some context -- and for other assignors that has included the PDF documents that we talked about. We would have requested all of that to be transferred pursuant to the assignment. Q. But, as you sit here today, you don't know if you requested PDFs or other images from AvMed, correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That would have been requested. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. But you don't know if it was requested, correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I'm sorry. I'm not sure the distinction that you're drawing. That would have been requested. That is part of the conversation that we have with assignors. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Who -- who at the assigners did you have that conversation with? A. We would have had that conversation with their IT department. Q. Do you remember anybody in their IT department? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't remember anybody specifically by name. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Do you recall the substance of the conversation? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. The substance of the conversation would be exactly what we've been talking about, the transfer of data, the claims data and any documents supporting the claims data. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. And they said that they didn't have anything; is that what the response was? A. The assignor told us that they would transfer what they had available to them that would be compliant with the request, obviously. Q. Well, you just testified that -- well, anyway, that's fine. Did -- you've already said that you didn't receive any images or PDFs of the -- relating to billing for services rendered by AvMed in that data transfer; is that correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. None that I'm aware of. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Would that have been reflected on the log if there had been any images or PDFs transferred? A. Yes. MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. Q. You looked at that this morning and you did not see any; is that correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That's correct. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Is the log that you're referring to, is that a log of the data and other information in the golden lock box, or is that a log derived from the copy of that data that is on the MSP Recovery, LLC, system? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. There are logs of both. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Which log did you look at? A. Both. Q. This morning? A. Yes. Q. On neither log did you see any indication that there were images or PDFs of any medical records or invoices relating to medical services? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Not to my knowledge, I didn't see any. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Okay. What agreement is in place -- well, what agreement is in place that allows an MA or an MAO to transfer data to MSP Recovery, LLC? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. There is an assignment, which -- a component of which has a data sharing agreement. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Are there any other agreements in place? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That's -- those are the only agreements that I can think of that are responsive to your question. Q. Okay. And then MSP Recovery, LLC, at some point, transfers or makes that data available to other assignees, correct? Related entities I think is the terminology that was used earlier today. MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I'm sorry. As you phrased it, I don't think that's true. We do not make the data available to other assignees. I'm not sure what you mean by that. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Do you make the data available to any entity that MSP Recovery, LLC, assigns specific claims to? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I'm sorry. Could you try just rephrasing it again? BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Sure. My understanding is that the plaintiff in this case is not MSP Recovery, LLC. A. That's correct. Q. Okay. Who's the plaintiff in this case? A. The plaintiff is the entity that was assigned the claims -Q. Okay. Hold on one second. And why isn't -- oh, I know why. Sorry. Give me one second. MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC, correct?A. Yes. Q. Is there an agreement between MSP Recovery, LLC, and MSP Recovery Claims, Series, LLC, regarding the data that is stored in MSP Recovery, LLC's, system? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. And do you know the date of that agreement? A. I'm sorry? Q. Do you know the date of that agreement? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. I do not. Q. Do you know approximately when the agreement was entered into? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. No. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Do you know what the agreement provides as far as -- well, do you know what the agreement generally provides? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. The agreement would be a claims servicing agreement. MSP Recovery, LLC, essentially acts as the claims manager and servicers. We ingest the data, maintain it, make it available for analysis, assist in collecting that data for whatever request there may be. Q. Okay. And in connection with the services agreement, do you transfer the claims data to MSP Recovery -- do you, MSP Recovery, LLC, transfer data to MSP Recovery Claims, Series, LLC?A. Data analysis is made available. Q. But you don't actually transfer the data? A. That's correct. Q. Okay. Is PII included in the data that's -- that is analyzed and shared between the two companies? A. Yes. Q. How many entities does MSP Recovery, LLC, service claims for? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. Approximately 162. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. So is that the same number as MAOs? A. No. Q. I'm sorry. That was a bad question. Is that the same number of entities that MSP Recovery, LLC, has ingested data from? A. Yes. I'm not sure if you're asking me a different question than you were at the beginning of the deposition. But MSP Recovery, LLC, has data, maintains data for approximately 162 different entities, those include Medicare advantage organizations and Medicare Advantage plans generally as well as commercial clients and hospitals and providers.Q. Yeah. My question was different. Thank you for the clarification. In this particular case, MSP -- as I understand it, MSP Recovery, LLC, is acting as the claims servicer or analyzer -- however you want to phrase it, please feel free to -- for MSP Recovery Claims, Series, LLC.How many other entities does MSP Recovery, LLC, perform the same function for -- same or similar function for?MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. When you say "entities," do you mean entities like the plaintiff in this case? Q. Yes. A. I'm sorry. I don't know exactly. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Do you know approximately? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. I don't want to guess. Q. Is it more than 100? A. I don't know. Q. So, as you sit here today, as the -- in charge of maintaining and analyzing medical claims data for MSP Recovery, you don't know how many entities it services; is that accurate?A. I do not recall specifically. I could look up that information. But I don't want to guess. Q. Okay. You don't know if it's over 100 or under 100? A. I don't want to guess. Q. Where would I find that information? A. On the MSP system. Q. What do you refer to those as? Those being -- what do you consider MSP Recovery Claims, Series, LLC? A. It's an assignee. Q. Okay. How many -- is there a list of assignees? A. Yes. Q. How is -- how are claims assigned from MSP Recovery, LLC, to different assignees? What's the -- what's the reasoning? A. Claims are not assigned from MSP Recovery, LLC, to those assignees. The assignment agreements themselves would convey that. Q. I gotcha. You don't know how many there are, correct?A. I don't recall at the moment. I don't want to guess. Q. Okay. A. I could look up that information. Q. Does MSP Recovery have any contracts with what you referred to earlier as third-party source? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. Just for the record, it's our position anything with regards to contracts or assignments are outside of the scope for Chris' deposition.You can answer.A. Yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Who are those contracts with? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. It could be with several entities. So for access to CMS's HETS database, which is where we do -- where we obtain the MMSEA 111 reporting, we have a contract with Ability -- or My Ability. That is one of the electronic data handlers authorized by CMS to provide access to that database. For the Medi-Span database, we would have access to Medi-Span the company and a contract there. I think those are the primary ones. Obviously, there's a contract with AWS for hosting services -- cloud hosting services.Q. Who -- I'm sorry, Chris. Don't let me ever cut you off. I did not mean to. A. That's okay. I think that was the totality of my answer. Q. Okay. Who holds the contract with Medi-Span; is it MSP Recovery, LLC? A. Yes. Q. Same question for CMS, I guess, My Ability. Who is -- who holds the contract with My Ability? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I believe it would be MSP Recovery, LLC. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Have you ever seen that agreement? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. I have. Q. When was the last time you saw the agreement? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Several months ago. Could be over eight months ago. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Is that a -- is it some sort of -- like Medi-Span -- I don't want to lump them together because I'll draw an objection. Is the Medi-Span agreement, is it a license agreement? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I believe it is in that context, yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. You kind of have to subscribe to it; is that -- I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. But is it like a subscription, like you pay monthly or annually? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I believe there's an annual renewal. Q. Okay. How about for the CMS, My Ability? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. I do not believe that that's a subscription service in the traditional sense. It is access to CMS's database. Obviously, there are some handling fees and processing fees associated with it. It's also a yearly renewal, I believe. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. So there is -- again, I want -- I drew an objection from your counsel as to form. Is there a fee that MSP Recovery, LLC, has to pay to have access to My Ability's data? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Do you know what that fee is? A. I do not. Q. Why does -- why does MSP Recovery, LLC, have an agreement with My Ability, what's the purpose? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I'm sorry. Why does MSP Recovery, LLC have a -BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Right. A. -- an agreement? Q. What's the purpose? A. As I've stated, it's how we see MMSEA 111 reporting. Q. When you say, "That's how we see MMSEA 111 reporting," what does that mean? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That is how we see reporting by required reporting entities that is mandated under MMSEA Section 111. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. So if -- in this particular case, if State Farm had reported, self-reported, you would see that in My Ability, correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I believe so, yes. Q. If State Farm hadn't reported section 111, you wouldn't see it in My Ability, correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. Again, our position is this line ofquestion is outside the scope. He can answer if he knows.A. I believe that we would not see it if it was not reported. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Right. What other information does My Ability allow MSP Recovery -- well, what other information does -- does the My Ability data provide to MSP Recovery, LLC? A. We have access to certain eligibility information and certain benefits information. Q. Okay. A. In addition to the MMSEA 111 reporting. Q. What's the purpose of having access to the My Ability data? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. It is where we see MMSEA 111 reporting by required reporting entities. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Is that the only reason that you have access to see those reports? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That is our purpose, yes. Q. Okay. Does MSP Recovery, LLC, ingest data from My Ability? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Is it targeted data regarding certain individuals? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. We would only receive data that pertains to the Medicare beneficiaries in our system. Q. When you say "Medicare beneficiaries in our system," what are you referring to? A. The Medicare beneficiary that pertain to the data that's received pursuant to the assignments, which roughly equates to 162 different assignors. Q. And in the data that's received from those 162 assignors, you receive data for non-Medicare qualified beneficiaries, correct?A. Some assignors service commercial line of businesses, yes. Q. Okay. In your claims data from insurance companies, you receive claims data regarding non-Medicare beneficiaries, correct? A. Yes. As you pointed out, typically that claims data would come under a separate cover in a different folder, but we do receive that. Q. What do you mean under separate cover? In a different folder? A. At the beginning of the deposition, we had the conversation about how data was transferred. I noted that some clients may service multiple lines of business. Typically a commercial line of business will be put in its own folder underneath that client's -- you know a subfolder underneath that client's folder. Q. Gotcha. A. Medicare. Q. Thank you for refreshing my -- I mean, understand -- yeah, that's cool. Thank you for helping me on that one. So am I correct that MSP Recovery, LLC, obtains claims data from -- approximately 162 MAOs it ingests the data and then runs searches, for lack of a better term, on the My Ability data to match beneficiaries?MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Yes. My only caveat is that -- as I pointed out, the 162 different assignors are not all Medicare Advantage Organizations. But, yes, we -essentially it's referred to as a "ping" of the HETS database through Ability for the Medicare beneficiaries to see if there's any reporting. Q. And then once you determine -- you being -- when I say "you," I mean MSP Recovery, LLC, not you personally. Once you determine that they are -- there is a primary payer that has filed a 111 report, what do you do? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That will trigger a slew of investigations. Members of my team will evaluate that. Members of the medical team will evaluate that. We will look at our algorithms to determine if there's any medical accident-related treatment. And then we will typically confer with counsel. Sometimes a demand will be made or civil remedy notice will be filed. And in some situations it will escalate into litigation.Q. Like what we're here for today, right? A. Yes. Q. What do you do as part of the investigation? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Primarily, we will review the medical claim lines. Where it's possible, we'll attempt to obtain medical records. We will see if we have a crash report information. We will see if we have any other reporting by any other entities. We'll kind of do the full investigation of the claim. Q. Do you only use the My Ability report to determine whether there is -- there has been a Section 111 report? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. You don't use any of the other medical information on the My Ability report; is that correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. The medical information we have access to on the reporting that we see is mostly limited to the benefits the beneficiary has and how much of those benefits have been claimed and their eligibility information. So, unless the primary payer or the required reporting entity in their note has affixed certain diagnostic or procedure codes, we do not see that through our access.Q. In connection with -- you mention -again, this is how I heard your testimony. If I'm wrong, let me know. You mentioned that you obtained -- as part of your investigation, you obtain medical records if available; correct?A. Yes, we will seek those records. Q. Okay. With regard to B.W., did you seek those records? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I do not specifically recall. We were not in receipt of any records, and I -- I don't recall specifically if we reached out to them. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Would you or your somebody in your investigation unit have done that? A. That would have been done under my supervision. I would have to check our logs to see if that was done. Q. Would there be a log entry of correspondence going out to the medical providers?A. Yes. Q. Would there be an image of the correspondence going out to the medical providers? A. If there was one, yes. Q. If I was to ask you to produce a log of any of entry -- a log of any requests made to obtain medical records related to B.W., could you produce that? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I could produce that if there were any such requests. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Right. If there's not, then just say "none," right. What about, do you ask for medical invoices from the MAO? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. The medical invoice from the MAO would be the medical claims data. So we're already in receipt of that. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. That's what you referred to a medical invoice, is the claims data? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. That essentially is what the medical claims data is. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Do you ask the providers for their invoices for the medical services? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. We will request for EOBs or billing statements, yes. Q. That would be reflected in the log? A. If a request had been made. Q. As you sit here today, do you know if those requests were made in the B.W. matter? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I do not. I'd have to check. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. When you're talking to MAOs, prior to data down -- ingestion, during the discussions are there -- are there generally discussions about what you don't want to receive from an MAO; what data you don't want or what information or documentation you don't want from the MAO? A. No. Typically, we ask for anything that's available. Q. Do you know -- I've already asked that. (Technical interruption.) THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record at 3:23. End of Media 1. (Recess 3:23 p.m. until 3:33 p.m.) THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record, the time is 3:33. Begin Media 3. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. To confirm, Mr. Miranda, you don't know what the MAO or MAs that you're requesting -- that you're ingesting data from, you don't know what they maintain in their records, correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Not specifically. You know, we have a general sense, right? Largely it is the EDI transaction, which is the medical claims data. That's how bills are paid and received, and that's what were in receipt of. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Right. But you don't know what's in their system, because you haven't -- they haven't given you access to it, have they? A. That's correct. Q. Okay. When you do the -- I think you called it the pinging process on My Ability, do you ingest all of their information into MSP's system? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. We are in receipt of certain report and information and that is ingested into our system, yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Does -- is that in excess to information relating to the individuals that you or otherwise have in MSP's system? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. We would only receive information from members who we had in our system. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. And then do you maintain the My Ability data in -- on the MSP system? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Yes. Q. How often do -- well, strike that. Do you update My Ability -- sorry. Do you update My Ability data on a regular basis?A. Yes. Q. What is the regular basis? A. Every beneficiary in the MSP system is cycled through at least once every three months. Q. Why do you do that? A. To see if there's any MMESA 111 reporting that has occurred since the last time we did the interface or the ping. (Technical interruption.) THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the record, the time is 3:37. End of Media 3. (Recess 3:37 p.m. until 3:40 p.m.) THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record, the time is 3:40. Begin media 4. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Is it fair to say that you focus on the Section 111 reporting in order to pursue claims such as the one B.W. that we're here on today? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. We obtain that information. THE VIDEOGRAPHER: It's frozen on my end. MR. MACEJKA: Already. We're going to transfer to -- we'll just do my laptop. THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Let's go off the record. (Discussion off the record.) BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. I believe you were about to answer if you remember the question. THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question? THE STENOGRAPHER: Yes. "Is it fair to say that you focus on the Section 111 reporting in order to pursue claims such as the one B.W. that we're here on today?"A. We obtain that reporting in order to determine if a primary payer has reported. In some context, we may determine that primary payer is not ultimately the liable party or whatnot. So we obtain it in order to supplement our information. It doesn't always lead to the prosecution of a case. Q. Are you aware of any case that was filed against State Farm that they hadn't filed a Section 111 report? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't specifically recall. I do know that we do look for that, instances where there has been no reporting, yet there are medical claims that that entity would be liable for. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. So, once you have that information, what do you do with it; what's the next step? A. That's just one piece of information that we attempt to collect. We do all the steps that we went through. The med team will analyze the medical claims data in conjunction with our algorithms. We will attempt to obtain whatever medical records we have. We'll look at crash report data. And then we'll confer with counsel about what the best recovery option is.Q. When you say "analyze medical data," what -- "per your algorithms," can you tell that to a layperson? What do you mean? A. We have a system of algorithms that help us to identify what may be related to a motor vehicle or slip-and-fall accident. Those things are flagged for us. Independent from that, there's also a medical team review. But essentially we're looking at clusters of diagnostic and procedure codes that are indicative of acute trauma or care associated with a motor vehicle accident.Q. By clusters, what do you mean? A. A collection of diagnostic and procedure codes. Q. Is that within a few -- is it within a few days of each other? A. They may happen sometimes within a temporal relationship, yes. Q. What's the temporal relationship that the algorithm looks at? A. Typically, we'll have a sense of the date of accident and so we'll look at the claim lines, which have certain diagnostic and procedure codes after that date of accident. Q. Is there a -- when you say "cluster," I think a bunch, they bunch around a certain time period. Are you saying the date of accident is that certain time period? A. Typically, yes. Q. Okay. Is the algorithm programmed to look on, you know -- look forward five days, three days, ten days, three months; what's the algorithm? A. It is programmed to do all of that. Typically, we'll get a cohesive analysis somewhere between 180 days to two years from the date of the accident. Q. That's a cluster? A. Within that range there could be clusters. Q. How would you define a cluster? A. It would be a collection of diagnostic and procedure codes that would indicate treatment for acute care or acute trauma associated with motor vehicle accidents or slip-and-fall accidents. Q. But that wouldn't extend over 100 -- I mean, you're -- are you saying that that would extend over 180 days, or are you saying -- are you saying that?A. There are some situations where treatment for a motor vehicle accident could extend well beyond 180 days. Typically, things like physical therapy could go well beyond that. Q. Yeah. But is that what the algorithm looks for? A. The algorithm is looking for all care associated with a motor vehicle accident. Q. Okay. Is it coded to look for a certain time period around a cluster? A. Yes. Q. What is that time period? A. It gives us gradual -- a gradual distance from that cluster, right. So we can see all of the clusters that are available within ten days, within 30 days, within 90 days, 180 days, and up to two years. So we receive all of that information so that we can see the full scope of the potential treatment. Q. Where do you receive that information from? A. We access that through the MSP system. Q. Where does MSP get that information from? A. From the medical claims data provided by the assignors. And, obviously, we're interfacing that with some of the information that we've talked about such as a MMSEA 111 reporting. Q. So you do pull additional information off the MMSEA report? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I'm sorry, no. We've talked about the primary payer reporting that will typically come with a date of accident, then we will look at the medical claims data and use the algorithms to determine what clusters of diagnostic and procedure codes around that date of accident. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. And the days that you said we could do it for ten -- I'm not giving you -- repeating exactly what you said. I think you testified that it gives you range of dates 10 days, 20 days, 30 days, three months, six months, whatever it is. Are those different algorithms that you run on the data? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. They are different queries that collectively are part of our analysis process, yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. That's the first analysis. So if you get a hit, that information shows up, meaning clusters and how far disbursed they are; is that correct?A. Yes. Q. Who has access to the MSP Recovery, LLC, AWS servers? A. That would be members of the IT department. Q. I believe we established that there's what -- hold on a second. A. About 30, 35 employees.Q. Okay. And are there different levels of access granted to each employee? A. Yes. Q. Okay. How -- what are the different levels of access? A. The different levels of access would depend on the employee's function. There's a base level of access. And the market distinction between that and a higher level, would be access to the golden lock box or the original record that's received from the assignors. Q. Okay. What are the different levels between basic and the golden lock box? A. There are just different accesses to different data sets. So employees only have access to derivative data sets. So that's workbooks and sheets of analysis, kind of downstream of the ingestion of data. And then there are other levels of access which provide access to the duplicate records that we talked about or the duplication of the original record that was received. Those would go through all of the processing steps that we conduct. And then there's access to the original record.Q. Okay. We've established that only one person has access to the original record, correct? A. I believe so, yes. Q. Okay. Who has access to the, I'll call it the "second copy"? You can call it whatever the appropriate term is. A. I believe there are roughly ten to 15 employees that have access. Q. Okay. What's their access level? Are they able to run queries? A. Yes. Q. Are they able to -- well, tell me what else they're able to do. A. They're able to run queries, view the results, generally follow the steps that are delineated in the pipeline that they're overseeing. Q. Are they able to manipulate the data? A. They would not be able to directly manipulate the data. The data would be kind of being processed in the pipeline. They would have certain functions and duties in that. But they, themselves, would not be manipulating the data. Q. What do you mean when you say "not directly"? That means the data can be manipulated indirectly, I assume. A. When we're dealing with that copy set of the data, we do go through normalization steps. So if the data comes in in year, month, date format, we may put that into a standard format using the MSP system. Maybe it's month, date, year. That could be considered a manipulation. Obviously, it's only happening in a derivative data set delineated as an MSP data set. But that process would be undertaken by the pipeline that they oversee. So it's not as though they are jumping into the data and typing something out. They are overseeing the process that is making those modifications for our analysis. Q. Does MSP Recovery, LLC, supplement the data? A. We do not supplement the original data sets or most of the copies. When we are enriching data with things like the My Ability report, that happens on its own environment, separately through its own tables.Q. What do you mean by that, enriching the data? A. So we will attach to a member a log which says, this member does have a MMSEA 111 reporting by a certain company. Q. How often did the -- let me make sure I understand. The data from CMS MMSEA is updated at least once every 90 days, correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Correct. Barring any availability issues or anything like that, yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. How often is the MAO data updated? A. That is contextual and depends on the agreement with the particular MAO. Q. Okay. Well, let's use AvMed as an example. How often is AvMed's data updated? A. We receive supplemental files roughly several times year. Sometimes the cadence is every other month, basically. Q. Is it automated? A. Yes. Q. What is the full subset of data -- what are all the fields of data that you guys receive from, let's use, AvMed? A. Where are they? Q. No. What are they? A. Oh, they're broadly about four categories of information or data fields that we receive. There is member demographics, so the name, certain identifying information. There is medical information, which is the diagnostic and procedure codes that we talked about a little bit. There are provider demographics; so what provider performed the service, who was paid, when were they paid. And then there are financial information; how much was paid, how much was billed, when it was paid. That sort of thing. Q. Do you do anything to verify the data that you receive from the MAOs? A. We do. When we ingest the data, we do compare it to other relevant data sets. We compare it to the information we're seeing on the eligibility sections of the My Ability reports. We compare the information with several of our third-party data sources to make sure it's correct. In the limited instances where we have medical records or explanation of benefits or transaction history, we do compare it there, and we've never seen any inconsistency.Q. The limited occasions that you have med records and I think you said transactional data, would that be bills and payments? A. Yes. Q. So you do have instances where you have that information, correct? A. Yes. Q. Those would -- that -- when I say "that information," I mean images or PDFs, correct? A. Yes. Q. You don't have any of those relating to this claim, correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Well, I believe we have them now because the defendants produced them. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. As to the -- the claims underlying this lawsuit? A. I do believe that there were records related to the claims underlying this lawsuit. Q. Okay. Have you checked those against your ingested data?A. Yes. As I noted earlier, there was nothing remarkable about it. That -- there was no inconsistency or -- essentially it all corroborated what was in the claims data. Q. Are you aware of what MSP is claiming by way of this lawsuit? What damage -- what about amount of money? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't recall the specific dollar value. It is the dollar value co-measured with the claim lines that were submitted. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. In your review of the documentation from -- received during the litigation that you mentioned earlier, doesn't change that position or that belief; is that correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I wouldn't think so. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Okay. Are you aware that PIP benefits were exhausted? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I believe so, yeah. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. That doesn't change your opinion on what -- the claim being made by MSP? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. No. Q. Why not? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. I believe this is more of a legal question. But there are -- there's case law that suggests that timing of payment is important. And the type of payment that is paid for is important. And that an MAO's recovery rights supersede any payments made for any extraneous care that may exhausted a policy. That's kind of a legal opinion that I'm drawing, and that's why exhaustion would not necessarily change my mind. Q. Did you happen to see that there was payment made for the exact same diagnostic codes? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. There very well may have been payment made for the same diagnostic codes. Typically, many, many claims will come with the same diagnostic codes, right. If I have a broken arm, that's going to be diagnosed as a broken arm, and I may have ten different things done to me, x-rays, a cast, a follow-up care performed because of those same diagnostic codes. So the payment of a claim line with similar diagnostic codes wouldn't mean anything. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Can you affirmatively testify here today that those diagnostic codes and the payments of them were for different services than the ones that State Farm paid? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't know that. I would have to review for that. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. What would you have to review for that? A. I would look at the information that was provided. I'd look at the procedure codes, and I would see if there are any overlaps in the procedure codes from the same providers for the same dates of services. If there are, that have been paid by Allstate, then that's a situation of double-dipping where the provider sent bills to both, in which case we would seek repayment from the provider in that context. But I don't know if that has happened here. Q. I'm just going -- not that I'm trying to correct you. You mentioned "Allstate" but you meant State Farm, correct?A. I apologize. Q. Don't apologize. I just want the record to be clear. A. Yep. Q. Do you investigate this before you file suit? Sorry. Do you investigate whether there's been prior payment before you file suit? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. We investigate whether there has been a reimbursement to the primary payer. Typically, we'll send demand letters or civil remedy notices seeking information from a primary payer about what they've paid. That is part of our process. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. When you send those letters, do you send them under a particular Florida Statute? A. Yes. MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. Sorry. A. Yes. In some context, yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Do you provide all of the information or documentation that's required under the Florida Statute along with the demand? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. Yes. We also are willing to engage with that primary payer should there be a subsequent request for information. We try and -- you know, we try to be as collaborative in that context as possible. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Do you have -- do you have records of those attempts of trying to be in communication or collaborate? A. Yes, they would appear in the logs. Q. Are those the same logs that you reviewed today? A. They would be different logs than the ones that we were referring to earlier when we were talking about the original data sets and their derivatives. But we do maintain those logs. Q. What would I call those logs if I was requesting them? A. Activity logs. Q. Those are created by whom? A. MSP Recovery, LLC. Q. What type of employee would create and maintain the activity logs? A. Those would be analysts under my supervision. Q. How many analysts do you have under your supervision? Is that the 30 or so you discussed earlier? A. No, the 30 or so that we discussed earlier were IT department staff, so those are programmers and developers. There are about seven to ten individuals in my department. Q. So do you -- have you reviewed the activity logs related to this claim? A. I did not review them before this deposition, no. Q. Have you reviewed them before? A. Possibly, yes. Q. Did you notice anything, I'll say, remarkable -MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.Q. -- in the logs? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. Sorry. A. Not that I can recall. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Do you recall the logs reflecting multiple calls from State Farm to MSP on B.W.'s case? A. I don't know. I'd have to check. Q. Okay. Did -- in this case, do you know if State Farm responded to MSP's demand letter? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't recall specifically. I'd have to check. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Do you know if MSP responded to State Farm's response to the demand letter? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I'd have to check. Q. Okay. Who is responsible for creating the demand letters that MSP Recovery issues? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. The demand letters would be created between members of my team, and they would be created in collaboration with counsel. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. If State Farm responds to a demand letter and requests additional information and documentation, would MSP -- should MSP respond? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That depends on the nature of the response and the relationship between the parties. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. You mentioned logs that you looked at this morning. I'm not sure if I asked you to tell me. If I was asking for those logs, what would I ask for?A. You could refer to them as data batch logs. Q. All right. Are there any other -- if State Farm makes a Section 111 report, and you have access to the CMS database, is there any additional information that State Farm -- are you able to see that they made the report? I mean, is there any addition -- my question is: Is there additional information that you wouldn't see in My Ability? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Yes. I do believe that under MMSEA 111 required-reporting entities do submit diagnostic and procedure code information, when they're aware of it, as part of their reporting. We do not see that in the Ability report. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. You're positive of that? A. I am positive that we do not see it in the Ability report. The only way that it would be there is if -- sometimes there's a note affixed to the primary payer reporting that -- on a very rare occasion -- may delineate some type of treatment or injury. But we don't see the actual codified diagnostic and procedure codes.Q. What do you see? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. We see components of eligibility, components of benefits and their accrual and the primary payer reporting. (Thereupon, the eligibility response was marked as Defense 11.) BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Let's put -- sorry guys. Give me one second. I'm going to mark as Exhibit 11 -- I'm going to mark as Exhibit 11 what I believe you're referring to. Can you see that on the screen?A. Yes. Q. Great. You're still with us, which is better than we've been doing. I'm going to mark this as Number 11. Can you tell me what this is? A. This is an eligibility response coming from the Ability platform. Q. Okay. So explain how this comes about. What's the process for getting to this point? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. As we talked about, the MSP system through an MPI will ping the Ability system. The Ability system then -- obviously, if the information provided is consistent with what's maintained on the HETS database, will then retrieve that from the HETS database and produce this report.Q. What's an API? A. An API is a direct programming interface with a system. So it's not as though somebody has to sit there and input information. The system is programmatically pinging the database that Ability retrieves from the HETS CMS database. Q. What is HETS? A. That's CMS's health exchange -- I'm blanking on the actual acronym. But it's the database of electronic records that CMS maintains. Q. Okay. I'm looking at the first page. I just want the record to be clear what we're looking at. Underneath that it says provider ID MPI in parentheses. What does that mean?A. Provider MPI is a national provider identifier, it's a ID that CMS makes available to providers so that they might bill CMS. Q. So who would use that number? A. Who has that number? It would be physicians who are available to bill CMS.Q. Why is that -A. I'm sorry. I should say, even though it's required for CMS, it's pretty much an industry standard most physicians will obtain their MPI number. Q. Okay. Is this MSP Recovery, LLC's MPI number? A. No. MSP Recovery, LLC is not a physician or a hospital. Q. Whose MPI -- provider ID MPI number is this? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't know. I'd have to look. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Where would you look? A. I would either look in the MSP system or you could look it up in the NPPES registry that is publicly available. Q. Okay. NPPES registry. Okay. Service dates 4/19/2017 to August 19, 2021. Do you know what those dates refer to? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That would be the range of dates in which services were provided for that beneficiary. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. This is her -- I guess -- I'm going off to the right where it says DOB So is -what's the relationship between her date of birth and the service dates, if there is one?MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't know that there is one. The date of birth is the date in which the person was born. The service dates is the range of time for medical services that were submitted pursuant to this request. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Who decides the service dates -- or, I guess, it would be MSP, right? A. I believe that that would be automated, and it would be commensurate with what's available in the claims. Q. What do you mean, "what's available in the claims"? A. So when this ping would have been done, the service dates in the claims available would have ranged from 2017 to 2021. Q. Would 2017 have been when she became Medicare eligible? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. It may have been, but that's not necessarily the case. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Did you create the algorithm that automatically sets forth the parameters? Or how did we get that date, is what I'm asking. A. That date would have been delineated in the algorithm that sets up the API connection. Q. What is the algorithm set to automatically populate that with? Like what does it look like -or look at or consider in deciding 4/19/2017 is when I'm going to start, and 8/19/2021 is when I'm going to stop? A. It is populating the service dates of the claims data that we received. Q. The claims data that you received is from the MAO? A. Correct. Q. Okay. The claims data dates, those are dictated by the assignment agreement? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. They may be. The assignment agreement may delineate a certain range of dates. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Next there is member ID 2GX9T50KR59. What is that? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That's the member ID for the individual in the medical claims data. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. So that's B.W.'s Medicare member ID? A. No. That's just their member ID. In this context, it could be an MBI. Q. What does that mean? A. That's the Medicare beneficiary identifier. It's the unique ID provided by CMS. Q. But that belongs to B.W., correct? A. Yes. Q. Under patient demographics there's a P.O. Box. Do you know what that is? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. No. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. And the gender is female. Is that referring to B.W.? A. It should be, yes. Q. It's an 18-page document, correct? A. Yes. Q. It has all of B.W.'s immunizations? A. It looks just to be COVID immunizations. Q. Okay. It has her Medicare Part D information, correct? A. Yes. Q. So it follows her whole Medicare history, Part D from -- through several different providers, correct? A. Yes. Q. Okay. Are you able to tell from this document when MSP Recovery, LLC obtained this -- or ingested this data? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't believe so. I would rely on the logs that we maintain. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Would the logs reflect when MSP Recovery, LLC, first received, I'll call the -- whatever you want to call this, the eligibility response from My Ability; is that fair? A. The logs would reflect that, yes. Q. Would the logs reflect it being updated every three months? A. It should. If there was no update to the report, it wouldn't register it as a log. We'd just -- you know, we'd see that it's consistent with the last report.Q. Is that automatically or does that require human interaction to compare and contrast? A. No, that's automatic. Q. Okay. And then there's a gold bar, status alert, Medicare Advantage. What does that mean? MR. MACEJKA: Objection, form.A. This would be a Medicare Advantage plan reporting coverage for the beneficiary. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. And I'm at the top of page 4. It goes through her whole history of her Medicare advantage and what insurance company it's with; is that correct? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And then the top of page 4, I see that AvMed is listed. A. Yes. Q. And is that within the date range that -of the incident? A. I believe so, yes. Q. Are -- the MAOs, do they have access to the Ability reports? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I do believe that they have access to the HETS database. I don't know if they have access or what electronic data handler they use.BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Well, if you have access to the CMS database, the HETS, I think is what you said, no matter what provider you use, you're going to have access to the same information; it may be organized differently, but the same information. Correct? A. I think generally that's correct. Q. Okay. A. Sorry, you just referenced an Ability report, which is this report. I don't know if they use this report specifically or any other report. Q. I don't -- it alerts -- it says status alert Medicare Advantage, correct -A. Yes. Q. -- AvMed? Okay. There's a status alert Medicare Secondary Payer Act above State Farm Insurance for 8/12/2012, and also below it for July 1st, 2002. What does that mean? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. Just for the record, plaintiff's position is that this line of questioning regarding the eligibility response is outside the scope of this deposition, but he can answer. A. That's a Medicare secondary payer alert. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Okay. So B.W. was involved in a prior no-fault accident in or about August of 2012, correct? A. Yes. Q. B.W. was also involved in another no-fault accident on or around July of 2002, correct? A. Yes. Q. So when MSP Recovery is -- when they are combing through the My Ability report, they're looking essentially for these type of status alerts that we have on page 4 involving Medicare secondary payer, correct? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Generally, that's the focus, yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. With that, MSP Recovery, LLC gets all this additional information regarding B.W.; is that correct? A. Yes. Q. Does MSP Recovery ingest all of this information and data into their platform? A. These parts of it that we're -- that are on the screen now that are referencing the benefits, no, we don't ingest this and maintain it.Q. All right. What data from this report does MSP Recovery ingest and maintain in their environment? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. The eligibility sections and then the status alerts. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. So pages -- on this report that I'm looking at, would that be the first four pages? A. Generally, yes. Q. How about any of the other 14 pages of information? Is there anything in there that MSP Recovery would ingest from this report into their platform? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Not really, no. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. How do they ingest -- how does MSP Recovery ingest it into their system? A. We receive the electronic record, and that is put on tables. Q. So my question -- I guess my question could have been better. Thank you for letting me know that. When you get the eligibility report, does it come in and it looks like this, as a PDF or an image? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. No. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Does it come in as data fields? A. Yes. Q. Does MSP Recovery, LLC dictate what fields it receives from the My Ability report? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. No. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Does it take it into a certain segregated -- does MSP Recovery, LLC take the data from CMS, My Ability, take it into separate segregated environment and filter or extract the data that it wants and ingest it into its platform? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. It is ingested in its own segmented space on our database. It only comes with certain fields. Typically, what we see from pages 1 through 4, and those are ingested as part of the MSP system. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Why does it only come with those certain fields? A. I don't know. The benefits information is largely irrelevant to our inquiry. Q. Yeah. That was my question before, and I didn't get an answer -- I don't think I got an answer. I'm not -- does MSP say to whoever is getting the data for them, so My ability, let's say, we only want fields 1 through 50 and don't send us fields 50 through 500? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. No. That API was set up in collaboration with Ability. Obviously, they -- ultimately they have control over what fields are disseminated and which fields are not. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. My Ability is the API, right? A. MSP Recovery, LLC maintains an API with My Ability. Q. Oh, I'm sorry. What does the acronym API stand for? A. I'm forgetting what the A stands for. But it is a programming interface -- I'm sorry, an automated programming interface. Q. Listen, acronyms are tough. Who is -- is that like a -- does the auto programming interface, is that like a subscription service?MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. No. That is programming and code that is developed between the parties to allow MSP to ping the Ability database if it meets certain conditions. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. So who developed the API? A. That would have been developed in collaboration with My Ability. Q. Who owns the API? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. Both parties own the databases, which that API or programming interfaces with. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Who hosts the database? A. CMS. Are you referring -- I'm sorry. I guess I should be clear. Are you referring to the HETS database? Q. I know HETS -- well, I believe HETS is maintained by CMS. But there's an interface -- as I understand your testimony, there's an interface between the HETS database and MSP Recovery, LLC, that is some sort of a database that was created in collaboration between My ability and MSP Recovery?A. The API connection was created in collaboration between MSP Recovery, LLC, and My Ability. The database maintained by MSP Recovery, LLC, is comprised of the medical claims data provided by the assignors. The interface is pinging against the HETS database referenced here in the document, Exhibit 11. And that is hosted by CMS. That connection is mediated by Ability as an electronic data handler. Q. Okay. Does anybody own the IP for API? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. It's a set of programming. I wouldn't say that anybody owns it. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. So was -- the collaboration in creating it between My Ability and MSP recovery, LLC, is that when it was determined what would be -what data would be received by MSP from CMS? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That would have been identified at that point, yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. So MSP Recovery, LLC did determine, in collaboration with My Ability, what data MSP Recovery, LLC would receive? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Ultimately, My Ability is the entity that would have made that determination. The API is essentially a feed of communication and then a receipt of information. So MSP's side of the API is fashioned to send certain information, qualifying information. And then Ability's side of the API is set to respond with information once it receives that qualifying information. So both parties would have dictated what they were sending.BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. When CMS receives that secondary payer alert that we were just talking about, does that -- is that communicated to the MAO? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. I don't -- I don't know specifically. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. But you know that the MAO has access to the CMS HETS system. A. I know that they generally have access. I don't know specifically what they have access to. Q. As you sit here today, you don't know if the MAO receives secondary payer alert notifications through their interactions with CMS's HETS database? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I believe they may. Q. But you don't know; you just believe that they may? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I think that that could be true, yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. I understand that. But do you know one way or another? A. I believe, yes, they do receive that information. Q. How regularly do they receive that information? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That I don't know. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Do you have an idea; is it once a day, once every three days, once a month? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't know. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Do you know how long an MAO should wait to make a conditional payment? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. That depends, and that's outlined by CMS in their guidelines and procedures for what's appropriate. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Do you know if an MAO has any obligation to investigate whether there is a secondary payer or primary payer? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I believe -- I believe that they do conduct that investigation pursuant to guidelines, as do all parties involved. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Are you aware that MAOs have access in real time to the CMS HETS database? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I believe so. Q. What is ISO? A. ISO is a third-party company where insurance companies can report information pursuant to claims made to them. Q. Does MSP Recovery, LLC maintain an environment for ISO data? MR. MACEJKA: Objection, form. A. We do have some records from the ISO database. It's a very de minimis amount of records. We do not maintain access to that database. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. When you say de minimis amounts of records, what are you referring to? A. It's a very small amount of records in comparison to almost anything else on the database. Q. How many years of information do you have? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. A. I would have to estimate, but I would say probably a year and some change. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Do you know from what date ranges, approximately? A. It would likely range from 2016 and 2017, something like that. Q. Is it -- does MSP Recovery, LLC update that information regularly? A. No. We don't have active access. Q. Is it a subscription service? A. It would be a contractual service. Q. Did MSP Recovery have access to it? A. Yes. Q. But it no longer has access to it? A. That's correct. Q. Did MSP submit information or filter information regarding B.W. through it's ISO environment? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. I don't specifically recall. If we had any information, it would have been produced. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. What do you mean, if you had any information it would have been produced? A. If we had any information from the ISO database, it would have been produced as part of the discovery in this case. Q. Okay. Did you look? A. I did not look specifically. Q. Okay. Who was responsible for looking for documents responsive to State Farm's request for production in this case? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. That would have been either myself or somebody on my team. If there was a responsive document, we would have produced it. I just don't specifically recall if there was. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Let me show you what's been marked as Exhibit Number 9 to Mr. Lopez's deposition and ask you: Have you seen this document before? I'm scrolling, but you can stop me and tell me to go up or down. MR. MACEJKA: Objection to form, outside the scope.A. I've seen portions the document, yes. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. I have highlighted on here Request for Production Number 1 and 2. I'll read number 2, which is, "Please produce complete copies of all bills or statements related to the treatment or services provided to B.W. for which payments form the basis of the claims in this action." Have you been asked or did you search for those documents? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. Yes. My department would have been asked. I would have supervised the searching of those documents. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Do you know if any of those documents were identified, located and produced? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. If any documents were responsive, they would have been produced. Q. Do you know if your department searched any ISO environment? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. We would have searched the documents which we had access to. So if there was an ISO document, we would have searched that and produced that, if it was responsive. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Are you aware of you guys locating any documents responsive to that Request for Production Number 2 that I just read to you; in other words, bills or statements relating to the treatment or services provided to B.W. for which payments form the basis of the claims for this action? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Anything responsive would have been produced, so I think the claims data was produced in this case. I'm not sure that it's exactly responsive to that request, but the Ability report 1 clearly was produced, that you put up as Exhibit 11. 2 BY MR. PENNEKAMP: 3 Q. Let me show you what has been marked as 4 Exhibit Number 10, and I'll show you the response, 5 "MSP Recovery does not have any documents responsive 6 to this request within its possession, custody or 7 control." 8 Did MSP Recovery, LLC request copies of 9 bills or statements related to the treatment or 10 services provided to B.W. from AvMed? 11 MR. MACEJKA: Object to form. 12 A. That would be the medical claims data. If 13 you're asking me about any paper documents, I don't 14 know. I would have to check the logs. But 15 typically, that wouldn't be something that we would 16 request. 17 BY MR. PENNEKAMP: 18 Q. Request for Production Number 1, which is 19 right above it, "Please produce complete copies of 20 all documents related to the treatment or services 21 provided to B.W. which form the bases of the claims 22 in this action." 23 Again, did MSP -- did the plaintiff, I 24 should say. Did the plaintiff request those 25 documents from the MAO or AvMed in this action? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. We would have produced any documents in our custody and control. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Well, is it your testimony that documents that are in the MAO or the assignor's possession, custody and control are not in MSP Recovery Claims, Series, LLC possession, custody and control? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. It's possible. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. That they are or they are not? I'm sorry. I didn't understand your answer. A. It is possible that there are documents not in MSP's possession or custody that the assignor may possess. Q. Okay. Do you know, as you sit here today, since -- it was -- my understanding of your testimony is that you were responsible for collecting documents responsive to the Request for Production, do you know if MSP requested those documents from AvMed? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope. A. I do not know specifically. We normally would not go and retrieve documents from outside sources unless a discovery request specifically called for it. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Do the requests I just read to you, do they specifically call for it? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. As I read them, no. BY MR. PENNEKAMP: Q. Okay. What about those requests for production -- are you seeing them? Are they up on the screen? A. No. MR. MACEJKA: No, they're not. MR. PENNEKAMP: Hold on. I apologize. Let me see if I can grab them back. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. What about the request for production that I just put up in the -- again, on the screen doesn't ask for those documents? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form.A. Generally, Requests for Production call for documents in possession of the entity from which they're requested. I don't think there is an obligation of that entity to go and seek those documents if it's not in their possession. So unless there was a specific request to do that or something, you know, that wouldn't be part of the normal course of business, to respond to a discovery request.Q. Okay. Let me show you what I have marked as -- I don't really recall what number it is. It's somewhere between 2 and 4. I'll straighten it out. Let me show you what's been marked as -looks like Exhibit 5, actually -- and ask you if you have seen this document before, which is the claims purchase and assignment agreement between -MR. MACEJKA: Go ahead, Mike. Sorry.Q. -- between AvMed and Series 1703615. MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope of this deposition.A. I've seen the document. I'm generally familiar with it. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Let me show you what I've highlighted as clause 1.1.3. Do you see that? Can you read it? A. I cannot read it. If you can zoom in a little bit.Q. I will. That's why I asked. We're all getting older. Let's see. You don't have to read it out loud. I hate when people do that. You can, but I'm not asking you to. One second. Are you able to read that? It's at 200 percent. MR. MACEJKA: Objection to form, outside the scope.A. Yes, I see this. This is what I was referencing earlier by some assignors providing us methods to obtain documents. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. My request is simply did you -- MSP Recovery, LLC -- request copies of all documents, records and information necessary -- well, strike that. Did MSP Recovery, LLC, request the documents that were requested of it or its related entity in Defendant's Request for Production Number 2 -- 1 and 2 from the assignor AvMed?MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. I do not specifically believe so. I would have to check our logs to see if that was requested, but I don't believe so.Q. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Give me one second. A. I'm sorry. While the -- while we don't have a question pending, could we take a quick break? MR. PENNEKAMP: Yeah. We can. We cantake sort of a -- yes, is the answer. I haveto take a break at 5:00. I'm hoping to finish,but I can't guarantee it. I'm just tellingyou, I'm happy to take a break, but then I needto take another at 5, a quick phone call.THE WITNESS: Okay. I'm sorry. I know that it's frustrating. I just need one minute. MR. PENNEKAMP: You are not frustrating me at all. I know I'm frustrating you. Go ahead. THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the record,the time is 4:48. End of Media 5. (Recess 4:48 p.m. until 4:52 p.m.) THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on therecord the time is 4:52, begin media 5. MR. PENNEKAMP: Thank you. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. In your review of this file, did you see anywhere the MAO AvMed put State Farm on notice of any conditional payments it had made? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. I do not specifically recall seeing anything like that. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. Did MSP attach any -- did MSP -when I say "MSP," I mean the plaintiff in this action or MSP Recovery, LLC, for purposes of this question -- ever provide the assignment agreements to State Farm -- the AvMed assignment agreement to State Farm before filing this suit? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope of this deposition.A. I believe that reference would have been made to them. I don't -- I imagine they would not have been produced. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Did MSP Recovery ever provide the medical invoice to State Farm for the services rendered which are the subject matter of the complaint to State Farm before filing this lawsuit? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope of this deposition.A. I would consider the medical claims data to be commensurate with that invoice. I do believe that the claim lines were produced under the demand. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Okay. And did -- did MSP provide any medical records to State Farm before filing this lawsuit? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. I do not believe MSP was in possession of any records and, obviously, would not have produced them. BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Did MSP provide any evidence of the MAOs' payment of conditional payments to the providers to State Farm before filing suit? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? Q. Did MSP provide any evidence of conditional payments made to B.W.'s providers that are the subject matter of the complaint prior to filing suit? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope.A. I believe so. The conditional payments as delineated in the claims data were provided on the matter.BY MR. PENNEKAMP:Q. Are those the actual conditional payments made -A. Yes. Q. -- or the billed amounts? A. Those are the lines for which conditional payments were made. Q. Okay. Is it your testimony here today that prior to filing suit against State Farm that MSP provided any evidence of the actual conditional payments made for the services and treatment indicated or sued upon in this matter? MR. MACEJKA: Object to form, outside the scope of this deposition.A. I believe that the claim lines are those in which a conditional payment was made and a demand, consistent with the regulations cited in the demand letter, were made. That may have reflected or referenced the billed amount for those services for which a primary payer would have been liable according to their policy and their agreements. MR. PENNEKAMP: Those are all the questions I have for you today, Mr. Miranda. I
