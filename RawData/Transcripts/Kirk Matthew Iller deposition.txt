BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Okay. Good morning. And Mr. Miller, can you please state your name for the record? A Yes. My name is Kirk Matthew Iller, last name is spelled I-l-l-e-r. Q I apologize, Mr. Iller. I don't know why I thought as Mr. Miller. Do you prefer to be called Kirk or do you prefer to be called Mr. Iller? A Kirk will be fine. Q I appreciate that. You can call me Joe. You understand you are here for the corporate rep deposition of Great American -- I apologize, let me say the name right, for Great Northern Insurance Company? A Yes. Q And Great Northern Insurance Company is also known as Chubbs? A It would be a singular form, Chubb. Q Are they also known as Chubb? A Yes. Q And how many times have you been a corporate rep for Great Northern Insurance Company or Chubb? And for purposes of the demo, I will refer to them as Chubb moving forward.A Yes, that's fine. This is my third time representing Chubb as a corporate depo rep. Q How long have you been working in the capacity of a corporate rep? A Since January of 2022, I was designated by my superior as a corporate representative. Q And just for clarity, was that when you were designated a corporate representative in this case or generally speaking? A Generally speaking. Q Welcome to the field. I hope it's been good to you so far. A It's fun. Q Good. I'm glad you look at it that way. Is this your first time testifying as a corporate rep? A No. Q How many times have you testified before? A Prior to this, two previous occasions. Q Have you worked with Mr. Holober before? A No, this is my first opportunity to work with Mr. Holober. Q Mine as well. Okay. And you understand that you are here to testify on behalf of Chubb or Great Northern Insurance Company? A Yes, I do. Q Do you understand that your answers will be based not only on your personal knowledge but based upon all information that is known to or available to Great Northern Insurance Company or Chubb?A I'm not sure I understand the question.Q In essence, I'm clarifying or confirming with you that you understand that your answers here today are not solely based on your own personal knowledge, but based on information that is or should be available to your client -- to the actual insurance company?A Yes.Q And you understand that if you don't know an answer, it's as if the insurance company or your client saying they do not know the answer?A Yes.Q Therefore, the answers you give here today will actually be the answers of Chubb or Great Northern Insurance Company.A Yes, understood.Q And do you understand -- strike that. I apologize. Are you aware that we sent a notice for deposition to Great Northern Insurance Company listing some topics for today's deposition?A Yes, I am.MR. TIMLICHMAN: Okay. And I'm going to show you now what the Plaintiff has pre-marked as Exhibit A. Sorry, that was my baby. (Exhibit A was marked for identification.) REPORTER: Mm-hmm. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q And I am now showing you what has been premarked as Exhibit A. This is the notice of taking deposition. Have you seen this notice before? A Yes. It's contained within the binder I received. Q Okay. And within that notice, did you review and see this Schedule A areas of inquiry? A Yes, I did. I reviewed it with my attorney, Mr. Holober. Q And did you look at any documents in preparation for today's deposition? A Only those that were contained within the binder. Q So, you have a corporate binder with you here today? A Yes, sir. I do. Q And are you going to be relying on the contents of that binder for the purposes of today's deposition? A Yes, sir, I am. Q And as part of Schedule B, we asked you to provide all documents relied upon when preparing for today's testimony. And as you should be aware, the Plaintiff would be entitled to a copy of said binder. Did you prepare a copy of that binder for us today? A To my -MR. HOLOBER: Joseph, I can give you a list of everything that's in the binder. My understanding is that you already have all the documents. If you want, I can go down that list right now. You can let me know if there's anything you don't have. We can send it over, but I believe you have everything. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Would you be kind enough to send me an e-mail with that list and I can verify. This way, we don't have to -- you know, I'll keep moving through, and if I see something on that email that I don't have, I will request for it. MR. HOLOBER: Okay. Will do. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q And, Kirk, let me ask you a -- I'm going to stop sharing the Schedule 1 for now. Are you at all familiar with Florida law as it is to insurance practices, good faith, bad faith, and overall, the duty of an insurance company in the state of Florida? MR. HOLOBER: I'm going to object to form. I'm going to object to any questions related to good or bad faith. Other than not noticed, that's not an issue in this litigation. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q You could still answer, Mr. Kirk. A Recognizing that I'm not an attorney, I'm familiar with it from the perspective of my adjuster's license and standing with the state. Q Okay. Would you agree with me that it's a fair statement that in the state of Florida, we have a policy of insurance companies should be adjusting and working with their insureds with an eye to provide coverage? MR. HOLOBER: I'm going to object based on this request bad faith information. But to the extent you can answer that, Kirk, you can go ahead. THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, Evan. I couldn't hear all that. MR. HOLOBER: I'm objecting on the basis of this request information related to bad faith. But to the extent that you can respond, you can go ahead. THE WITNESS: It's our position that we are always interested in providing coverage under the policy where coverage exists. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q And you would agree that the policy in the state is that when you can find coverage, you should always find that coverage. The insurance company shouldn't be looking for a way to escape coverage, they should be looking for a way to find coverage. Is that right? MR. HOLOBER: Form. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q You can answer, Mr. Kirk. A That is our stated position. The objective is always to try to find coverage and present coverage where possible. Q And Mr. Kirk, would you agree with me that as part of that duty and stated position, the insurer has an obligation and duty to investigate the claim? A Yes, that is correct. That's part of our opportunity to find coverage. Q Okay. And I want to show you now -- just give me one second. I apologize with these exhibits online and all that good stuff. It'll take me a second here and there. Just bear with me, I apologize. MR. TIMLICHMAN: All right. I'm going to show you now what's pre-marked as Exhibit B. I'm going to share screen again. (Exhibit B was marked for identification.) BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q This is a letter sent by a Mr. Harrison Guber to Mr. Rothschild on December 31, 2020. Is that correct? A That appears to be correct. Q Okay. And within this letter -- strike that. Is this letter confirming that Chubb is acknowledging Mr. Rothschild's claim of loss? MR. HOLOBER: Form. You can go ahead, Kirk. THE WITNESS: This does not appear to be an acknowledgement, but rather a form of -- I have to read this exactly. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Well, in the second paragraph it says, "We acknowledge that on December 2, 2020, we received your claim for damage to your home at 1574 Quayside Terrace D18, Miami, Florida, which reportedly occurred on November 25, 2020." The loss description indicated patio damages with ensuing interior water damages and then they go on to discuss, you know, that they regret it occurred. And then they go on into the next paragraph. So, just going back to my original question, would you agree that this is an acknowledgement letter of the claim for the loss that occurred on November 25, 2020? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: I would state that there is an acknowledgment paragraph. However, the letter itself appears to be a reservation of rights letter. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. I'll accept that. And within this reservation of rights letter, what is the acknowledged date of loss? A The acknowledged date of loss which was reported by Mr. Rothschilds is November 25, 2020. Q Okay. And in the -- one, two, three -- in the fourth paragraph, what does Chubb correspond to Mr. Rothschild? A Let me read the entire paragraph before I answer, please? Q Sure. A That paragraph acknowledges that we have a responsibility to thoroughly investigate, and we are informing Mr. Rothschilds, in that paragraph, that we have referred an engineer, an expert, Donan, to investigate and assist in the discovery of the cause of loss to his property as he has claimed. Q Okay. Happy you said, "thoroughly investigate." Kirk, would you agree with me that "thoroughly investigate" does not mean "speculate?" MR. HOLOBER: Object to form. Object that this is outside the scope of the notice. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q You can answer, Mr. Kirk. A It's always our position to investigate any claim thoroughly. Q Well, my question specifically was, would you agree that "thoroughly investigate" does not mean to speculate? MR. HOLOBER: Again, same objection. THE WITNESS: I would have to ask you your definition of "speculate." BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Sure. If you give me one second, I will give you my definition of speculate. Speculate would mean to "form a theory or conjecture about a subject without firm evidence." MR. HOLOBER: To the extent that it's a complete question, I object to form. I also maintain my objection. This is outside the scope of the notice. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Your objection is noted. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Mr. Kirk, you can answer. A By providing a professional engineer to investigate and inspect the loss, we're going to rely on their professional opinion based on their observations. At no time does any investigation include destructive testing on ours or our representatives' behalf. Q Mr. Kirk, I'm going to stop you and ask to strike your answer as not responsive. I think I asked you a very simple, direct question. Would you agree that "thoroughly investigate" -- I didn't ask you about who you rely on, and I didn't ask you about how you do testing. Respectfully, I ask you again. I ask from Chubb, I'm not asking you. Does the definition of "thoroughly investigate" mean to speculate? MR. HOLOBER: Objection. This is outside the scope. MR. TIMLICHMAN: It's a yes or no. Mr. Holober, your objection is noted. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q It's a yes or no question. Does "thoroughly investigate" mean "to speculate?" It's a simple yes or no. MR. HOLOBER: I'm going to object. This is outside the scope of the notice. It is outside -MR. TIMLICHMAN: Mr. Holober, you are now doing speaking objections. Your objection is noted to the question. You've made your objection three times. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Mr. Kirk, please answer my yes or no question. A Thoroughly investigating does require some interpretation of the observations, which some might interpret as speculation. Q And you would agree with my definition of speculate of "form a theory of conjecture about a subject without firm evidence." MR. HOLOBER: I'm going to object. This is outside the scope of the notice. You are asking for the deponent's personal interpretation of your interpretation of a definition. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Mr. Holober, I'm striking your objection. You are not allowed to make speaking objections on the record. I'm not asking for his personal interpretation. Chubbs put a stated position in a letter. They stated, "It is our obligation to thoroughly investigate," I'm quoting. I'm asking the corporate rep, not Kirk -- asking the corporate rep of Chubb if their definition of "thoroughly investigate" includes speculation, with the understanding that speculation carries a definition of "form a theory of conjecture about a subject without firm evidence." And your objection, Mr. Holober, is noted. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Mr. Kirk, it's a yes or no answer. MR. HOLOBER: I'm going to repeat my objection. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Mr. Holober, I'm going to move to strike, and if we need to call the judge to get her involved, I have no issue doing so. It is improper for you to interrupt, post speaking objections. You've made your objection for the record. You will have your opportunity to go in front of the judge and move to strike my question. Your objection has now been noted five times. And I ask you, respectfully, to either instruct your client to answer or to not, or we can call the judge right this second and ask for ore tenus motion on this question. This was part of the scope because my areas of inquiry reaches to all correspondence from Chubb. This is a direct correspondence from Chubb in regards to a policy provision. I am well within my rights to ask, and Chubb is well within their obligation to answer the definition of the words they chose to use in any letter dealing with coverage. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Mr. Kirk, one more time, respectfully, does the definition of Chubb's obligation to "thoroughly investigate" include speculation, yes or no? MR. HOLOBER: I'm to repeat my response, my objection. Kirk, to the extent you're able to answer on behalf of Chubb, please go ahead. THE WITNESS: The word "thoroughly" does not include any reference to the -- your definition of speculation, no. Q Okay. So, you would agree that thoroughly investigating something in line with your previous testimony that insurance companies in the state of Florida are required to adjust claims with an eye towards coverage means that in their investigation, there should be a certain level of sound evidence prior to them making a denial. Is that a fair statement, Mr. Kirk?MR. HOLOBER: Same objection, but, Kirk, to the extent that you are able to answer on behalf of Chubb, please go ahead.THE WITNESS: That is a fair assessment. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Okay. And in this letter, you refer to Donan to be your expert engineer to investigate this cause of loss. Is that correct?A That was who we designated to assist in the investigation.Q So, you relied on Donan in making your decision as to whether or not there should be coverage in this claim?A We relied on the information provided by the Donan engineer. That is correct.Q And you, in essence, relied on them to do a thorough investigation?A That is correct.Q And you would agree based on our discussion, that a thorough investigation that was the basis of speculation would, in fact, not be a thorough investigation. Is that correct?MR. HOLOBER: Form. But you can go ahead.THE WITNESS: It is our position that Donan's investigation was thorough and did not include any basis of their opinions on speculation, only on evidence they could observe.MR. TIMLICHMAN: Okay. I appreciate that answer. Let's move on. I am now going to show you what has previously been marked as Exhibit C.(Exhibit C was marked foridentification.) BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Mr. Kirk, I'm now showing you what has previously been marked as Exhibit C. Would you agree that this is Chubb's denial letter of the coverage?A I would agree that that is Chubb's partial denial of coverage. We have extended coverage for ensuing water damage.Q Okay. So, on the onset, Chubb agrees that there is somewhat of a covered loss?A By this letter, we have extended coverage to the damage to the garage below the patio. Q Okay. And what does it say in this first part of this letter? What does that first sentence say? A "After investigation, a partial denial was created for your claim to the tile damages." Q My first question is, why didn't it say, "after a thorough investigation?" MR. HOLOBER: I'm going to object to the extent that this seeks bad faith information. But to the extent you are able to respond, please go ahead, Kirk. THE WITNESS: So, no indication that that word "thorough" is required. It's just stating that we have investigated. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q So, you would agree there's a difference between a thorough investigation and an investigation, right, Mr. Kirk? A No, I would not. Q Okay. Fair enough. Why did they choose to use that in the first letter and not in this letter then? A It's just part of the standard language for our letters. We're advising in the first letter that we're going to conduct a thorough investigation. And in this partial denial response, it’s a response, "Here is our investigation results." Q This letter is dated February 11th, right? A Yes, it is. Q But this wasn't the only letter Mr. Rothschild receives from Chubb on February 11th? A I believe there is a second letter. Q That's right. There's a second partial denial letter.MR. TIMLICHMAN: And I am now showing you what has been previously marked as Exhibit D, which is the second February 11 coverage denial letter.(Exhibit D was marked for identification.) BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q And are you familiar with the contents of this letter? A Yes, I have read it before in our review. Q Okay. And what does it say in this paragraph? In the second paragraph of the letter, what does that say? Would you mind just reading that in for the record?A The second paragraph of the letter says, "We regret you sustained this loss to your property. Please be assured that we have undertaken a thorough investigation, determined the cause of the loss and applicable coverage under your masterpiece policy." "Unfortunately, after careful consideration of the facts of the loss, and the policy terms, Federal has determined that there is a partial denial for your loss. We would like to take this opportunity to fully explain the basis for our decision." Q So, my first question is, who's Federal? A I believe that that was a mistake in the letter. Federal is another one of the underwriting companies that Chubb represents. Q Understood. So, Federal was a typo. And you would agree with me, Mr. Kirk, that that word "thorough investigation" pops its head up into this paragraph again. Is that right? A In this paragraph, yes. Q Okay. And Chubb says they'd like to take the opportunity to fully explain the basis of their decision of their denial. You would agree with me, Kirk, that the law requires them to do so? A Yes. Q And Kirk, you would agree with me that the insurance company is required to state their position of denial at the time of denying the claim, and they're not able to change that position as to why they denied later in the litigation. Is that correct?MR. HOLOBER: Form.MR. TIMLICHMAN: You can answer.THE WITNESS: I don't believe that is correct. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q What about that statement did you feel is not correct?A Well, this particular letter states that we don't have coverage, but the subsequent letter indicates that, yes, we do have some coverage that we have extended.Q Okay. I'll take that. I appreciate that, but you couldn't come 6 months later and say, "We made a mistake for why we denied your claim. Here's the real reason why we denied it." As the insured -- we have the insured -- I apologize. We have the benefit of relying on your denial letter as the stated position for why the claim was denied. Is that correct?A I don't think I understand your question. MR. HOLOBER: Form. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Saying you can't create a moving target. You know, when you issue a denial letter, you kind of have to stand by the facts of the denial letter, because, as you stated, you thoroughly investigated. It's not speculative and this is why you're denying it. It's not going to change later. So, we can rely on that reasoning within the denial letter. MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: This letter, which you've not asked me to address, does contain the reasons that we are denying the damage to the tile -- the claim damage to the tile. The subsequent letter, which I believe is dated the same date comes back and advises that, yes, we do have coverage for the ensuing water damage below, this area. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q I understand that. So, it's safe to say, Kirk, there's no other reason why you denied this claim, other than what's in this letter that we're looking at that's been previously marked as Exhibit D. Is that correct? A That is correct. Q And it says within the letter, again, that the loss occurred on November 25th, correct? November 25, 2020, that's when it was reported. MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: By Mr. Rothschild, yes. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. Let's just count it for accuracy -one, two, three -- in the fourth paragraph, they've completed the engineering inspection with Donan of the home on January 6th. A copy of that engineer report has been sent to us or to him, to Mr. Rothschild, for his review. And the report stated that, "There was a deficiency in the water proofing layer, which caused damage to the tile as well as ensuing water damage to the interior inside of the home." Is that correct? A That's what the sentence states. Q So, Chubb is saying, the last sentence, "The improper installation of the waterproofing layer falls under the exclusion of your policy." A That is correct. Q So, it's the improper installation of the waterproofing layer. That is why Chubbs denied this claim? A That's the basis along with the other exclusions listed. Q Well, let's see what the other exclusions are. The other exclusions you have listed -- can you tell me what the other exclusions are that they're relying on and that they're listing? A Well, the paragraph above would go to the second exclusion, the faulty planning construction or maintenance -Q Mm-hmm. A -- but the additional exclusion is the gradual or sudden loss. Q Okay. That says, "We do not provide coverage for the presence of wear and tear, gradual deterioration, rust, bacteria, corrosion, dry or wet rot or warping, however caused, or any loss caused by wear and tear, gradual deterioration, rust, bacteria corrosion, dry or wet rot or warping. And we also do not cover any loss caused by inherent vice, latent defect, or mechanical breakdown. But we do insure ensuing covered loss unless other exclusion apply." A That is exactly how that read. Q Okay. This sentence, "We do insure ensuing covered loss unless another exclusion applies," so is that why they decided to cover the electrical box damage below? A Yes, I believe that is correct. Q Okay. So, they're blaming the faulty under lining. They're not blaming Hurricane Eta in this letter, are they? A No, we are not. Q In this letter, nowhere takes the position that this is not a covered loss because of Hurricane Eta. Is that correct? A That is correct. Q Nowhere in this letter does it say anything whatsoever about windstorm exclusion or no windstorm coverage or anything of the sort. Is that correct? A That is correct. Q It also doesn't mention anything about rain, excessive rain, thunderstorms, tropical storms; doesn't make any mention of any of that within this letter. Is that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. You can go ahead. THE WITNESS: No, it does not. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q So, Mr. Kirk, you would agree with me that Mr. Rothschild was very well within his sound reasonable logical right to assume that the only reason he is not getting coverage is because the insured is stating that the improper installation of the waterproofing layer falls under an exclusion under the policy. Is that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. Also, questions regarding Mr. Rothschild personal opinion are outside of his scope of the depo. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Mr. Holober, again, I ask that you don't make speaking objections. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q And for clarity, Mr. Kirk, I'm not asking you what Mr. Rothschild's subjective understanding is. I'm asking you, is Mr. Rothschild entitled, objectively, as a insured under this policy -- as any insured under any policy -- to rely that according to this denial letter, the only reason his claim is being denied is because the improper installation of the waterproofing layer falls under exclusion in the policy? MR. HOLOBER: Same objection, but, Kirk, to the extent you're able to answer on behalf of Chubb, please do so. THE WITNESS: Yes, that would be correct. And if you will scroll the letter up, I'd like to add -- I'm sorry, down. Thank you. In the gradual or sudden loss exclusion, it does indicate that we do not cover a loss caused by inherent vice, latent defect, or mechanical breakdown. So, those are the bases under the gradual or sudden loss. And under faulty planning, construction, or maintenance, it refers to design compacting, settling specification -- setting specifications, developing property, establishing building codes or construction standards. And construction includes materials, workmanship, and parts or equipment used for construction or repair.So, there's not a singular reason Mr. Rothschilds could rely on. He has to rely on the context of the exclusions in the policy that are cited. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q I understand, but this exclusion circles around and relies around the fact that the -something -- I apologize. Give me one second. My computer froze.That exclusion, that paragraph that you just read in, relies around Donan's finding that the improper installation of the waterproofing is what caused the damage. Is that correct?A That was the opinion of the Donan engineer and it was supported by the indications in the report.MR. TIMLICHMAN: Okay. Let's get to the next -- let's get to Exhibit -- A, B, C, D -- E. I'm going to now show you what's been previously marked as Exhibit E. This is the Donan report. Okay. We're now my share screen again. (Exhibit E was marked for identification.) BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Mr. Kirk, would you agree with me that this is the Donan you are -- well, strike that. Let me authenticate it a little better. I am now showing you what has been previously marked as Exhibit E, the Donan report. Mr. Kirk, will you agree with me that this is an accurate copy of said report? A It appears to be an accurate copy of the report provided by Donan. Q Okay. And have you had the opportunity to look at this report? A Yes, I have. Q So, my first question, Mr. Kirk, is -- let's first identify who this report was prepared for. Who is Mr. Harrison Guber? A He is a former adjuster here in the Chubb group of companies. Q You mentioned "former." Is he no longer with the company? A No, he is no longer with the company. Q Okay. And he was within his authority to order this report. Is that correct? A He was within his authority to order the report with approval by his manager at the time. Q And let me ask you a question, Mr. Kirk. When these reports are made, are these reports created for guidance or are they instructive? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: They are created for guidance. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. So, if something's in the report that the insurance company may or may not agree with, they always have the right to either disregard it, get another engineer, get another report, or make their decisions based on the best information they have. MR. HOLOBER: Form. You can go ahead. THE WITNESS: The best information that we have at the time. If additional clarification is required, if there's a confusing information in the report, we'll ask for clarification. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. Let's go through the report. And this report was seemingly created on January 12, 2021? A That appears to be the date on the cover letter, yes. Q And you agree that the denial letter was issued about a month later, on February 11TH. Is that correct? A That's what I recall, yes. Q Any reason that it took so long to get the denial letter to Mr. Rothschild? A No, other than, I think, timing of the year, some of the, you know, events that are going on. I can't explain why it took a month to get the denial letter out other than perhaps a good review of the report. Q Understood. Okay. Let's read the first paragraph. In the first paragraph, in the second sentence, can you read that into the record for me, Mr. Kirk? A Second sentence in the paragraph says, "The purpose of the study was to determine the cause of water intrusion through the patio into the parking garage." Q So, the scope of this report was specifically to determine the cause of the water intrusion through the patio. Is that right? A Ultimately, to determine why the water was getting into the parking garage. Q Okay. And you would agree with me, Mr. Kirk, that based on the scope of work Chubb provided to Donan, Donan would have assigned the proper engineer to the report. Is that correct? A I would assume that they would assign an appropriate engineer, yes. Q And well, again, for clarity, you would agree that the appropriate engineer would be based on the scope of work. So, one kind of leads the other? A Correct. Q Okay. And you would agree that not every engineer is going to specialize within the same topic, right? So, you could have a structural engineer versus a, you know, landscaping engineer or, you know -- all sorts of different engineers out there. MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: That is correct. I believe this engineer is a structural engineer. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Nothing in the scope of work over here talks about determining the age of loss, right? Doesn't say anything about that, right? Nothing about the age or how long the loss was occurring? A It does not specify that we've asked for information on duration, but that could have been verbally asked. I don't know. Q Whether it was verbally asked or not, Mr. Kirk, you'll agree with me that it's not in the written report. It's not expressed in writing, right? A It's not expressed in this paragraph, no. Q Okay. So, it doesn't say anything about determining whether or not there was long-term seepage or long-term leak. Nothing about that, right? A Not in this paragraph. Q And nothing in this paragraph about studying rust or determining how long the rust buildup was there from. Nothing about rust at all, was there? A Not in this paragraph. Q And Mr. Kirk, let me ask you a question. Do you have a background in adjusting? You mentioned you have a license in adjusting earlier? A Yes, I do. Q So, how many years have you been adjusting for? A I've been an adjuster for 14 years. Q So, is it fair to say you're somewhat familiar with building materials, construction materials? You'd have to have some knowledge of that to be a effective adjuster. You'd agree with me on that? A It makes for a good adjuster to have that kind of experience and background, yes. Q So, let me ask you, are you familiar with any methodology that an engineer can implore in determining the age of rust or the age of water staining on building materials, such as concrete or sheet rock or pavement? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: As I'm not an engineer, I would not be able to answer that question. You know, my experience is limited to that of an adjuster. I do not have the designation of professional engineer, so I would not be able to answer that question. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Well, as the corporate rep for Chubb, has Chubb ever explored or hired an engineer that was capable of determining the age of a water stain on a ceiling? A I believe we asked them for their opinions. How they go about determining that, I have no knowledge of. Q Okay. But for clarity, the opinion asked for here was to determine the cause of the water loss, not the age of the water loss, correct? A That was correct. Q Okay. And you would agree with me that the scope here also does not ask for any weather-related analysis? A The previous question and the question you're asking, though frequently appear in the reports, because as part of the investigation, the engineer is going to provide an opinion as to what they see. The purpose of the study is what he was tasked originally to do and he can expand the scope as necessary to explain his observations and conclusions. Q Okay. I'm going to ask to strike that answer as not responsive. I think my specific question is, did the scope of this study ask to study the age of the loss? You answered "no." Is that correct? A That is correct. Q And then my follow up question was that was, did the scope of this study ask to determine any questions of weather? A No, it did not. Q Okay. And you agree with me that the denial letter did not make any mention in regards to Hurricane Eta, whether rain, storm precipitation, or how much rainfall there was around the time of the loss. That's a correct statement, right, Mr. Kirk? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: That is correct. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. And you'd agree with me that an engineer is not a meteorologist? A I would agree with that. Q Okay. So, any findings that an engineer makes as to weather would be based on not necessarily expertise within his licensed field, but within his everyday common knowledge and the utilization of things like Google and searching websites like the NOAA? MR. HOLOBER: Object to form. I'm also going to object to the extent that this appears to be outside of the scope of the notice, but, Kirk, to the extent you are able to answer on behalf of Chubb, you can do so. THE WITNESS: I would agree with that. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Okay. And, Mr. Holober, you know, just for the record, we're asking about your engineer report. This is very well within the scope, and I believe any question revolving around this would be within the scope of that. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q So, looking through this report, Mr. Kirk -and you're familiar with it -- what in the report --does the report explain how Mr. Rothschild was made to be brought -- how -- strike that. How was Mr. Rothschild aware of the leak in the garage? A It's our understanding that the homeowners' association reported to him that there was water dripping on a vehicle that was parked under this area. Q And that's in this report here, right? This statement in the background -A Yes. Q -- that Mr. Rothschild stated, "On or around November 25, 2020, he was informed his patio was leaking onto a vehicle in the parking garage below?" A That's what the report states, yes. Q Okay. I have a question. Do you know how many years Chubb had been providing Mr. Rothschild with insurance at that point? A Off the top of my head, I don't. I'd have to have you, if it's in the record, show me how many years we have insured him. Q Would you agree with me that it was for more than one year? A I'm relatively certain it was for more than one year. Q And if I told you it was for more, like, six or seven years, would that sound reasonable? A I would hesitate to answer that question because I can't be sure. Q Okay. I'll accept that. Mr. Kirk, let me ask you this then. Are you sure that this was the first time Mr. Rothschild reported this leak? A To my knowledge, it was the first time he reported this leak. Q So, that means this would have been the first time the HOA or the building had informed him that there was leaking onto a vehicle in the parking garage below? MR. HOLOBER: Object to the extent that Plaintiff's personal knowledge is outside of the scope of notice. MR. TIMLICHMAN: It's not what I asked. And I ask again -MR. HOLOBER: (Cross talk). MR. TIMLICHMAN: -- Mr. Holober, it's improper -- you repeatedly do speaking objections. It's improper for you to do so. I ask to strike that objection and I ask you refrain from doing speaking objections. Mr. Kirk is more than able to answer these questions. You can object and seek to strike my questions if the judge feels the need to do so at a later time. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Mr. Kirk, I'm asking you to make a logical inference. You agree that according to this report, and the result of your investigation, that Mr. Rothschild reported that he was put on notice of the leak because the homeowners' association of the building or the property he lives on, put him on notice, that the vehicle in the garage below was leaking. That is a true statement, right? That's a yes or no. You've already answered "yes" to that. A The only one we are aware of. Q Okay. And you would agree this is a logical inference that if there was water leaking on the car in the garage below, the homeowners' association would have certainly informed Mr. Rothschild about that leak in prior incidences. Isn't that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. I'm going to repeat my objection to the extent this requests. Again, Plaintiff's personal knowledge -MR. TIMLICHMAN: Mr. Holober, you've made your objection -MR. HOLOBER: Please do not interrupt me. Please -MR. TIMLICHMAN: Mr. Holober, you are making speaking objections, so I'm going to interrupt you every time. MR. HOLOBER: Okay. MR. TIMLICHMAN: You can make an objection -MR. HOLOBER: I'm going to state my objection for the record. MR. TIMLICHMAN: You can make your objection -MR. HOLOBER: I'm going to state my objection for the record. This asks him to make inference about Plaintiff's (cross talk) -MR. TIMLICHMAN: You are now -- Mr. Holober, look, hold on. Hold on. You are making a speaking objection. We can go off the record. We can call the judge. You can ask the judge to hear your objection and make a determination as to whether or not it's proper, or you can acknowledge that it's improper because you're a seasoned lawyer and not make speaking objections. Which way do you want to go? MR. HOLOBER: Let's go do it then. MR. TIMLICHMAN: I'm not going to allow it. I'm not going to allow it. We can call the judge. I'm giving you two choices. We can call the judge --MR. HOLOBER: Let's call the judge. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Okay. MR. HOLOBER: Call the judge. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Let's do that. One second. REPORTER: We're off the record. You want to go off the record then? MR. TIMLICHMAN: Let's go off the record. You folks can -REPORTER: We're off the record at 11:04. (Recess.) REPORTER: We are back on the record at 11:22. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Good morning, Your Honor. THE COURT: Good morning, everybody. MR. HOLOBER: Good morning, Your Honor. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Thank you for taking the time out of your busy day. You know, it's just lawyers being lawyers. All in good fun, but we're having a very slight debate. Me and Mr. Holober have a very professional relationship, nothing but absolute respect to each other. I am the Plaintiff -- in the case, the Plaintiff's attorney. The individual, Mr. Kirk Iller, is the corporate representative of the insurance defense company. And Mr. Evan Holober is the Defense attorney. Our dispute between Mr. Holober and I -- a very respectful dispute is, I don't appreciate him taking the extra step of explaining why he's objecting to my questions. And I'm asking him not to make speaking objections. I believe that a proper objection would be form, speculative; form, hearsay; form, asked and answered. I believe that the objection after that should stop. Mr. Holober -- I will not speak to his argument, but my feeling is that there's extra instruction almost to the client as if to why he feels it's speculative or why he feels it's hearsay. And I believe that's where it peers into a speaking objection from just an objection. And Mr. Holober, you can, obviously, make your argument. MR. HOLOBER: My understanding was that where you were calling about this specific instruction not to answer on the most recent question. MR. TIMLICHMAN: It's fair enough. That's fine, but it's generally speaking that question and in general for the purposes of the deposition, and, Your Honor, I believe the court reporter can play back the question and objection to you if you want them to hear it.THE COURT: Okay. So, let's take this then in two parts. So, Mr. Holober?MR. HOLOBER: Yes.THE COURT: So, the first issue is that you're making speaking objections and -MR. HOLOBER: Yes, so -- go ahead.THE COURT: No, go ahead, tell me your thoughts on this.MR. HOLOBER: I believe the extent of the objectionable objections have been to the extent that I've objected that certain questions are outside the scope of the notice and outside of Mr. Iller's role as corporate representative. Josef, I don't know if you disagree with that.MR. TIMLICHMAN: Again, I think that my position and what I'm looking from the Court is that if there's an objection, there should be an objection made with either hearsay, speculative, outside of the scope, whatever, but nothing more.It shouldn't attack the actual specifics within the question or the actual factual analysis. That should be done before Your Honor at a hearing when we do our depo designation, so on and so forth. I don't -THE COURT: Okay. So, actually, you're being even more generous than I would permit. Yes, normally, objection should only be to form. You don't even have to give the problem with the form. So, you don't even have to say hearsay, unless the attorney asks, "What's the objection?" Then you can go further and say, "It's hearsay." But the sufficient objection is "Form." Now, because -MR. HOLOBER: Can I ask for clarification? THE COURT: So, if you want to ask for clarification as to why -- if you're objecting to form and Mr. Timlichman -- what is it? How do you say your name? MR. TIMLICHMAN: Timlichman. THE COURT: Timlichman. And Mr. Timlichman is wanting to know why you're giving a form objection, then you can go a little further and explain if you want, but I do agree and the courts in this district agree that speaking objections are inappropriate and often amount to witness coaching. Now, you have this particular witness here as a 30(b)(6) witness or a person with the most knowledge. That presents a different issue. Then it's your second issue that Mr. Timlichman raised or you must have raised, which is, if questions are being asked that are outside the scope that was provided in the 30(b)(6) notice, then now, you've asked about whether he can be instructed not to answer, and it is the only time outside of privilege and work product that the courts will condone instructing a witness not to answer, if it is outside the scope of the notice provided as to what the 30(b)(6) witness is going to testify to, and that objection needs to be stated. That's not coaching the witness because, you know, either the witness is going to answer or you're going to say -MR. TIMLICHMAN: Right. THE COURT: -- "He's not here for that question. That wasn't part of the notice." So, to recap, regular objections should only be to form unless there is a question regarding why. If the questioner is asking why you're objecting, then you can give a little more. Otherwise, you should not be explaining your objections because it does often amount to coaching of the witness. MR. HOLOBER: Understood. Do you want to -THE COURT: But you are permitted to instruct opposing counsel that you're going to advise the witness not to answer if you, legitimately and in good faith, believe that a question is outside the scope of the notice provided regarding the topics that Mr. Miller is here to testify about. MR. HOLOBER: Thank you, Your Honor. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Thank you. Okay. All right. MR. HOLOBER: Joe, do you want me to get a specific ruling on the most recent question while we've got the judge here? MR. TIMLICHMAN: I would like a specific ruling on those two, and for clarity, Your Honor, and I'm agreeing with what you're saying because I don't mind Mr. Holober explaining his form objection. That doesn't bother me. But even to what you're saying, for clarity and for the benefit of the parties here, if Mr. Holober feels my question is outside the scope of inquiry, then the proper objection at that point would be, I'm instructing my client not to answer, not to get into the specifics of the question and the specifics of the factual things within the question, and then start analyzing why that may or may not be within the scope. THE COURT: Right. I mean it's a simple "that's outside the scope of the 30(b)(6) notice." And I get your point, because very often, what can happen is, you know, "Well, this is outside the scope of the 30(b)(6) notice because he's only here to talk about accounting practices." MR. TIMLICHMAN: Right. THE COURT: But, you know, he doesn't know about whether they use, you know, this form of accounting practice and our company uses -MR. TIMLICHMAN: Correct. THE COURT: You don't need to go into that. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Exactly, Judge. THE COURT: It can be very simply, you know, "This is outside the scope of the notice." And you're probably going to disagree about that. That's natural, but that, you could preserve on the record. MR. HOLOBER: Okay. Understood, Your Honor. So -THE COURT: Ms. Villegas, am I speaking too fast? I apologize if I --MR. TIMLICHMAN: No, you're perfect. I've really -MR. HOLOBER: She's doing an audio recording. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Yes. MR. HOLOBER: She's audio recording, so she'll be able to transcribe it from the audio. MR. TIMLICHMAN: So, based on that, Mr. Holober, do you -- I mean, I think the answer has already been stated. But do you want the judge to hear the objection and the -- I mean, you're here already. Madam Court Reporter, would you mind playing it back for the judge? REPORTER: Certainly. Standby, it takes me a moment. THE COURT: I could probably guess why that was outside the scope of the notice. Right. So, the way it should work is, Mr. Holober, I think if you just object, Mr. Timlichman asks what the objection is -- object and the witness doesn't have to answer. Mr. Timlichman can ask you what basis for that is and you're going to say, "It is outside the scope of the 30(b)(6) notice." And then if you guys want to have a discussion about why, that's fine. But I mean, if you're going to explain why the witness shouldn't have to answer it, you're probably going to end up having a discussion anyway. But you probably don't need to state that at length why, unless Mr. Timlichman asks for it. I don't know anything about this case, but I've done enough coverage cases to know -- you know, it sounds, to me, like he's being asked to testify.I'm speculating here, it sounds like he's being asked to testify about what the Homeowners' Association should or should not have known, as opposed to what the carrier knew. But anyway, I digress. Yes, I think that your objection can be much shorter and simply that it's outside the scope.Mr. Timlichman is not going to agree with you a lot of the time when you say it's outside the scope, and then you can have a discussion about that. But I don't think it needs to start like that. It's clearly holding things up.MR. HOLOBER: Understood. Do you want to get a specific ruling on that last question?MR. TIMLICHMAN: No.MR. HOLOBER: Do you want to do that?MR. TIMLICHMAN: No. I think you look-I agree it's asking –- fine, we're asking a speculative question. That's my right to try to ask that. If you objected, I don't want you to explain to your client why you think it's speculative. I don't want you to explain to your client what your legal reasoning is as to that. The reason I cut you off is because you were going into an explanation about how it's asking for inference for him to think of -- you make your objection, either instruct them to answer or don't. That's what I'm looking for. And then I'll rephrase my question accordingly. That's really it. MR. HOLOBER: Okay. MR. TIMLICHMAN: You know, I'm not trying to be overly difficult. I just don't want Mr. Kirk to have -- and no offense to Mr. Kirk. He's a great witness. He's a gentleman. THE COURT: Oh, I called you Mr. Miller. So, what is your -- it's Mr. -18 MR. TIMLICHMAN: Kirk is his first 19 name. 20 THE WITNESS: My last name is Iller, 21 actually. We put the M between the K and the I. 22 THE COURT: Oh, so it doesn't look like 23 killer. 24 THE WITNESS: So, it doesn't look like 25 killer. M is my middle initial. THE COURT: Okay. That's funny. Okay. Well, if you have me, if you want me to rule on that specific objection, I don't think you need me to, unless Mr. Timlichman is going to now insist that Mr. Iller answer that question. MR. TIMLICHMAN: No, I'll rephrase it. THE COURT: Okay. MR. HOLOBER: So, I'll just (cross talk) -THE COURT: And I don't even think speculation was the issue. I think speculation would have been a form objection. Just from the little that I'm hearing, it sounded like you were asking him to testify regarding the homeowners' association, and I believe you said he's from the carrier. So, you probably -MR. HOLOBER: Well, I'll just say objection outside the scope. Instruct not to answer. Move on. THE COURT: Outside the scope of the notice, right. MR. HOLOBER: Okay. We can do that. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Thank you so much, Your Honor. We really appreciate it. Happy Friday. Hopefully, you can get out of the office earlier than we are. MR. HOLOBER: Thank you, Your Honor. THE COURT: Well, yes, we'll see about that. But absolutely, and thank you, Ms. Villegas, for arranging to have me come in. REPORTER: My pleasure, Your Honor. THE COURT: And if you guys need me, you know how to reach me here. You're lucky, I was supposed to have a settlement conference this morning, and it got -- it settled. So, I'm here. MR. HOLOBER: You're lucky. THE COURT: All right, guys. Well, good luck. I appreciate that you guys are handling even what could be a very contentious dispute so professionally. So, I commend you for that. And you know, hopefully, you won't need me again. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Thank you. THE COURT: Have a good day. MR. HOLOBER: Thank you, Your Honor. REPORTER: Bye. Thank you very much, ma'am. THE COURT: Thank you. MR. TIMLICHMAN: All right. REPORTER: Okay. MR. TIMLICHMAN: So, I will withdraw my last question for ease. I appreciate that we did that. So, we got some ground rules we can all live by. Evan, I really hope I didn't offend you.MR. HOLOBER: All good.MR. TIMLICHMAN: And we'll go back on the record for the purposes of our line of questioning. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Mr. Kirk, we left off at discussing the report that I had previously marked as Exhibit E that was issued by Donan. In our conversation, the communication was resulting around what has now been deemed my speculative question regarding the HOA's notice of the damage.So, what I will do is I will rephrase and go back to that question, ask it a different way. Is that okay with you, Mr. Kirk? Are you ready to begin again?A Perfectly fine.Q Okay. So, my question is, according to this report, and according to the investigation, Mr. Rothschild was put on notice of the damage ensuing in the garage from his homeowners' association. Is that true?A That is correct. Q And it is also fair to say that this is the first time that Chubb received a claim for Mr. Rothschild about there being ensuing damage through this particular electric box into the garage? A That is correct. Q So, this claim had never happened before. A To my knowledge, no. Q And Mr. Rothschild has never made a claim to Chubbs about this leak before? A No. Q So, from that perspective, it's a new issue. From the perspective of Chubb receiving a damage claim for Mr. Rothschild, this is a new claim. This is a new issue. A This would be our first notice, yes. Q Okay. Like, he had a previous claim with Chubb for termites. Are you aware of that? A Yes, that information was included in the binder. Q So, if he would have had a termite claim, then you would agree that then it would not be a new issue, that it would have been something that was recurring and something that he had previously claimed on? MR. HOLOBER: Form. You can answer. THE WITNESS: If I understand your question, it's related to the first -- to the second claim. So, if the second claim were a termite claim, then I would say yes, we had previously handled one, but this one was for some ensuing water damage. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. And so, for purposes of that, Mr. Rothschild has never made a claim to Chubbs about a leak in the garage or damaging somebody else's car or anything of that nature. A No. Q Okay. Now, we had previously discussed the scope of work in this report. Is that correct? A Yes. Q Okay. And as part of that, you acknowledge that nowhere in the scope was there any discussion about weather-related analysis. A Correct. Q But on this page, in the report, and we're looking at page 4 of 19 of the actual PDF, the engineer gives a whole discussion about Tropical Storm Eta's path. Is that correct? A That is correct. Q Okay. Can you show me where in this report the engineer provides any information as to his --what's the word I'm looking for? His credibility or his ability and resume to speak onto weather topics. A Of course, I'd have to read exactly what he's saying, but I think he's presenting this in the context of there was a tropical event that could have introduced a significant amount of water to the property. You know, otherwise, we don't have any water damage if there's no source of water. So, I believe he's just speaking to the fact that this was potentially the source of the water initially. Q And but again, my question specifically is there anywhere in his report that he gives us credentials that he is qualified to talk about weather or weather-related incidents? A I don't believe he is a credentialed meteorologist. No. But he's not making those statements. He's extracting this information from reports. Q Right. And he's basing the extraction of that information based on his personal knowledge, not on his knowledge as an engineer. A I'm sorry, I don't understand your question. Q His opinions as to the weather and the weather-related discussion within his report, it's not based on his engineering degree or his engineering qualifications, right? It's based on his personal knowledge and sound reasoning.MR. HOLOBER: Form.THE WITNESS: That would appear correct, that again, in context of the report, he has to figure out what the potential source of the water was. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q And would you agree that a storm is not the source of the water loss? Well, let's strike that question. Let me ask it a better way.You would agree that this report in your denial letter blamed the water flash -- the underlayment being improperly installed as the cause of the water loss. Isn't that correct?A That's the basis of the denial, yes. Q So, how does Hurricane Eta come into play? A Hurricanes, typically, in -- for the record, this is indicated as a tropical storm, not a hurricane. However, they have -- they contain rain. Q Is rain an exclusion under the policy? A No. Q And here's a question for you. Does Chubb write insurance during a named storm or a named hurricane? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: We do not bind policies during an active storm, no. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Or an active hurricane, correct? A That is correct. I'm not aware of any carrier that does. Q Okay. When does a carrier usually lift the restriction of writing policy? A No, I wouldn't be able to answer that question. That's a question for underwriting. Q Okay. In the conclusion of the paragraph, in the end of the report on page 6, can you read these last two paragraphs before the conclusion? A Do you want me to read? Q I would like you to read them into the record, if possible. I apologize for the redundancy of it. But actually, I need you to start from here, "In its simple form." A Okay. "In its most simple form, which is essentially a roof, a plaza deck must include a weather -- a waterproofing layer. Deficiencies in the waterproofing layer, and specifically its interaction with flashing junctures, can lead to catastrophic deterioration of the underlying framing components." "Thus, appropriate waterproofing details during the design and construction phase are critical to a plaza deck's long term and reliable performance. The waterproofing layer is typically accomplished by using single ply membranes or paintable membranes." "This waterproofing layer should be installed in a shingle-like fashion at all flashing junctures, promoting positive drainage to the exterior. The waterproofing layer should extend up behind the wall's drainage plane, and drainage weeps should be at the base of the walls for proper drainage." "The waterproofing should extend up or otherwise sealed to the base of columns, railings, or other penetrations. Door thresholds are preferably installed above a curb that raises the door above any potential ponded water. Proper sealing between a door threshold's sill pan and the waterproofing layer is critical when the threshold is installed at or near the plaza deck elevation." Uh, you scroll too high, please. Q Oh, I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry about that. A "A plaza deck must incorporate a proper wearing surface to protect the underlying waterproofing from the area's intended occupancy. Given the wearing surface's intended function is not waterproofing, the material used can vary from continuous coverings such as mortared tile to intentionally spaced coverings such as wood decking." "A spaced wearing surface, such as a wood decking, has increased accessibility and improved ventilation to help dry any stray water, but wood may not fit within project requirements regarding framing clearances, maintenance, or aesthetic conditions required." "A continuous wearing surface such as a mortared tile has the advantage of shedding more water before it reaches the waterproofing layer, but it also inhibits drying of any stray water and can make accessibility for repair or maintenance quite difficult." "A well-designed plaza deck will account for a waterproofing layer to protect the space below, a wearing layer for expected traffic, and a drainage layer to let water between them escape." "The drainage layer should discharge at internal roof drains or extend to flashings or weeps along the structure's exterior perimeter. When the plaza deck is over a conditioned interior living space, an insulation layer should be included to account for thermal transfer." Q Okay, Mr. Iller. I appreciate you reading that into the record and I'm sorry that I had to ask you to do that. My first question to you is, what did we just read? A We read a statement of opinion from the professional engineer about the construction and nature of a plaza deck. Q So, this was not actually about Mr. Rothschild's plaza deck, this was just general in nature. Is that correct? A It was a reference to how a plaza deck should be constructed, yes. Q And within it, he says, "Thus, appropriate waterproofing details during the design and construction phase are critical to a plaza's long term and reliable performance." Is that correct? A That is correct. Q How do you interpret the design and construction phase? What does that mean to you? A That means to me that when the building was constructed, that appropriate design and specification should indicate how that plaza deck should be constructed. Q Can you show me in this report where Donan references, relies on, attaches, or states that they even looked at any of the design or engineering drawings associated with what they have dubbed the plaza deck of this property? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: I don't recall any of that being included in the report. To my knowledge, it was not requested or supplied by Mr. Rothschild. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Do you know if Chubb requested it? A I do not. Q Do you know if Chubb requested it of the HOA? A I do not. Q Do you know if Chubb requested it of the building department? A I do not. Q If they had, would they have given it to you? A Unfortunately, that has to be -- that's speculative. I don't know if we would have received it or not, even if it was asked. Q But you are the corporate representative, right? A But the question was, would it have been given to us. Q Well, to you as the corporation. If Chubb would have went as far as looking into finding the drawings, I mean, you agree with me that this report basically says the design and construction phase is critical. I mean, they used the word critical, right? So, you would agree that those drawings and how those drawings and construction was done is something that would have been available to Chubb should they have wanted to receive it. Do you agree with that? A I don't know whether they would have been provided. Q Well, Mr. Kirk, you would agree that Chubb as an insurance company that's writing insurance, should be aware that any plans submitted to the building department is public record, right? A They're part of the permitting process, yes. But again, that doesn't mean that they would be available to us. Q Okay. Well, let's go back to the areas of inquiry. Showing you Schedule A of the area's inquiry, Exhibit A. It's been previously --A Mm-hmm. Q -- marked as Exhibit A. And question number seven and eight says, "Facts surrounding the underlying accident known to Defendant, Great Northern Insurance Company, and relied upon in reaching its coverage position," and "the facts surrounding any accident investigation" is something that you were put on notice to be aware of for today's deposition, right? A Yes. Q Okay. And going back to Exhibit E in this report, it says that critical to appropriate waterproofing details are designed in construction phase for long-term reliability, right? That's in the report. It says that, correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: The engineer is speaking generically, not specifically about this plaza deck. He is describing any and all plaza decks. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q I understand. And he's saying that how the plaza deck is designed, right? Because when a contractor builds a plaza deck, he's relying on the plans, right? Mr. Kirk -A Correct. Yes. Q Okay. So, this report says that those plans and drawings are critical. You agree with that, right? A What -- please explain what you mean by critical. Critical to who? Q Critical to Chubbs as part of their investigation in determining whether or not the flashing and waterproofing layer was installed properly. A No, because the statement says, "Thus appropriate waterproofing details during the design and construction phase are critical to a plaza deck's long term and reliable performance." Q Right. A It doesn't -- it did not say it was critical for us to understand whether this was constructed properly. Q Mr. Kirk, is it your testimony that it doesn't matter whether or not this was constructed properly? A It absolutely matters. Absolutely matters if it was constructed properly. And the engineers included in his conclusions that it was not -Q Mr. Kirk, I didn't ask you -- I'm sorry to cut you off. I didn't ask you that question. A Okay. Q What I asked you is wouldn't verifying the plans and drawings be critical to determining whether or not this was installed properly? A That would be for the engineer to determine. Q Okay. And I'm asking you, did the engineer attach any plans and reports or any drawings whatsoever as to the waterproofing? A Of this particular installation, I am unaware of any. Q Okay. And I'm asking you is if he wanted that information, that information is a public record and available to him, if this building and townhouse were built under a permit. MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: To my knowledge, it potentially is available to him. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. And if it was part of his investigation, that is information that per your notice of inquiry, you would have been charged with knowing today. Meaning, if you relied on using those plans or reviewing those plans, you would have been made aware of that. A Yes, we relied on the engineer's report. Q Okay. So, my question then is, is it fair to say that the engineer did not rely on, see, seek, or look at the plans and design around the installation of this waterproofing and underlayment in coming to its conclusions in this report? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: There's no indication he looked at the specific plans or designs to this plaza deck. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q And you would agree with me that if he did look at those designs, and the engineer would have found that the design drawings were done improperly, that would have been a black and white answer and evidence of an improper installation. Was that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: That might be his interpretation. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. But you agree that did not occur here? A I agree he did not review any specific plans or information relative to this plaza deck. Q And earlier, you testified that you don't engage in any destructive investigation when investigating a claim. Is that correct? A We do not task our representatives, such as an engineer, nor do we task our adjusters to perform any kind of destructive activities on the property. Q Okay. So, what did he based his opinion on then, Mr. Kirk? A Well, I have to assume that he based his opinion on his experience and knowledge of structural design and function. Q But in this case, it was based on his visual observation? A His conclusion stated here on the report showing, it says, "Based on the staining on the garage ceiling below, rainwater is migrating through the plaza deck." So, he's telling us that the water is leaking through to the area below. Q And he's basing that on staining? A He's basing that on staining, and then the information he was provided that the homeowners' association had notified Mr. Rothschild that water was dripping on a vehicle parked in the space below. Q But you previously testified that this was the first time Mr. Rothschild ever made this claim, correct? A Yes, and I'm just restating what we were told. Q I understand. And I'm asking you, you just read that "Based on the staining on the garage ceiling below, rainwater is migrating through the plaza deck." So, what is that based on? Is that based on his visual observation? Did he visually observe staining on the garage ceiling and therefore came to this conclusion?MR. HOLOBER: Form.THE WITNESS: That is one of his observations. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Okay. And over here, he says, "The waterproofing layer of the deck is not accessible with the wearing surface tile in place." Would you agree with me that he's admitting in his report that he's not able to visually see the waterproofing layer because there's tile on top of it?MR. HOLOBER: Form.THE WITNESS: Yes, I would agree that that's what he's saying. To see that area below would require destructive testing. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. So, he never actually saw the waterproofing. Is that correct? Yes, or no? A That is correct. Q And he never actually looked at the plans to see how they were installed. Is that correct? A I believe we have established that. Q Okay. And here in his conclusion, he says, "The water intrusion would not occur with a properly installed waterproofing layer and wall flashing." Is that correct? A That's what his -- that's his statement, yes. Q And would you agree with me that the use of the word, "the water intrusion would not occur," is speculative in nature? A I would state that that's based on his experience and knowledge with construction in structural plan or structural design. Q And is that based on the staining? In his conclusion, his first sentence is the staining. So, you would agree that this whole conclusion of construction defect design is based on the fact that there was staining on the garage ceiling. Is that right? A I would not agree with that. Q Okay. Well, then, explain to me what the conclusion is based on. A Let's read the entire conclusion in the summary of the conclusions. Q Okay. Well, it says, "Based on the staining on the garage ceiling below, rainwater is migrating through the plaza deck." So, you just said that he's not basing it on his visual observation of the staining on the garage ceiling. Can you explain then why that sentence is there? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: I say it's part of his overall conclusions. There's more than one conclusion stated in that paragraph. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Well, let me ask you a question. He then says that, "Although the water intrusion could not be replicated." So, can you explain that? What does he mean by "the water intrusion cannot be replicated?" A I believe in the report discussion above, he tried to replicate it by literally using a garden hose to spray water in the area and try to observe a leak while on site. He was not able to accomplish that. Q When he did that, he was assuming that that leak was caused from that drain above. Is that correct? A No, sir, he was assuming that the water was coming from the area above, which would include the tile, the waterproofing layer, potentially the drain. He's trying to find out and replicate the water intrusion. Q Well, aside from the water intrusion in that particular spot, did he take the hose and test any other areas to your knowledge? A To my knowledge, he tested the area that was associated directly above where the water was reported as having manifested below. Q And nowhere else? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: I don't know where else he would test other than the area directly above where the water was reported to have fallen. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q That wasn't my question of whether you would know where that testing can occur. I'm asking you whether he tested any other area, or was it exclusively to that one particular area and nowhere else?A I believe we'd have to refer to his report to get that exactly, but I think in general, that was the area he tested. Q Okay. And here, he says, "The cause of the plaza deck water intrusion is installation deficiencies in the waterproofing layer and door wall flashing." But you would agree with me that he did not see with his own two eyes, the installation of the waterproofing layer and/or the wall flashing because it was under the title, correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: That is correct. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q And then he says, "Based on the heavy corrosion in the ceiling electric box --" A Mm-hmm. Q "-- and cementitious repair of the garage ceiling, the water intrusion has repeatedly occurred over a long-term period of years." Is that correct? A That's what the statement reads. Q Okay. Let's go back to his scope of work. Where in his scope of work does it say that he was going to determine the age of the loss? A So, the purpose of the study was to determine the cause of water intrusion through the patio into the parking garage. During his study, he provides his professional opinion as to the length and duration of the damage. Q My question is, where in your report, in this report, does his scope make that request of him to determine the length and duration of the loss? It doesn't say, does it?MR. HOLOBER: Form.THE WITNESS: It does not specifically request that. Again, he has provided that based on his experience. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Okay. And you earlier testified that you agreed with me that the engineer would be chosen based on the proposed scope of work. Isn't that correct?A That is correct.Q And you agree with me that there exists no methodology or testing in this report whatsoever that discusses how this engineer would have made a determination as to length and duration of the loss. Is that correct?MR. HOLOBER: Form.THE WITNESS: That is correct. It's not requested specifically in the report. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q All right. And more importantly to my question is, nowhere in this report is there a discussion of a methodology used to determine the duration and length of a loss? A That is correct. Q Okay. And nowhere in this report is there a request to make a determination as to the weather conditions on or around the date of the covered loss. Is that correct? A That is correct. Q And you agreed with me that the engineer is not a meteorologist and not a specialist in weather, to your knowledge? A To my knowledge, that is correct. Q But you would also agree with me that in his conclusion, he writes in two different occasions that based on the staining on the garage ceiling below, rainwater is migrating through the plaza deck. And then again, he says, "Based on the heavy corrosion in the ceiling, electrical box, and cementitious repairs of the garage ceiling, the water intrusion has repeatedly occurred over a long-term period of years." So, his opinion is somewhat based on two areas that were not part of the scope of Chubbs hiring him. Is that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: That is correct. It's his professional opinion. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q I understand. But you didn't ask him for that part of his professional opinion. That was not included in the scope. Is that correct? A He provided it based on his observations. Q Well, how did the heavy corrosion in the ceiling of the electrical box have anything to do with how the water got there? Could you correlate that for me, Mr. Kirk? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: No, other than the water would have had to have contacted the electrical box to corrode it and rust it. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. Was that in your scope? In your scope, did you say, "Hey, engineer, I want you to analyze the corrosion and rust on the electrical box?" MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: I believe it's been concluded that that was not part of the request. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. I just want to make sure. And can you please just articulate to me where in the report he explains what methodology he has used to come to the conclusion that the water intrusion has repeatedly occurred over a long-term period of years? Is there anything -A Pardon (ph) -Q Okay. How does he know it wouldn't have been for over a long-term period of years versus -let's just say for argument's sake, over a long-term period of months? Does he give us any indication as to how to make that differentiation? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: It is not specified in his report, no. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Does he give us any differentiation as to how he's qualifying his statement when he says, "the staining on the wall?" Does he even tell us how dark the staining is? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: He does not tell us. He provides photographs of the box. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. And is his opinion about the staining on the wall based on his visual observation? A I would agree that that is what he's relying upon, yes. Q So, is this engineer suggesting through that statement and your understanding that he can look at the staining on a wall and tell us how long there has been a leak based on that visual observation? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: I don't think he's telling us that at all. He's just telling us he observed the staining. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Well, he's also telling us that it happened over a long-term period of years, but he provides no explanation as to how we got there. Isn't that right? A I believe we've already established that. Q So, you're saying yes? A I'm saying yes. Q And in his summary of conclusion, he writes, "The cause of the plaza deck water intrusion is installation deficiencies in the waterproofing layer and/or wall flashing." And then he states, based on the heavy corrosion in the ceiling, electrical box, and cementitious repairs of the garage ceiling, the water intrusion has repeatedly occurred over a longterm period of years." Is that -MR. HOLOBER: Form. Asked and answered. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Is that the two conclusions that he's formulating? A That's what’s stated in the report, yes. Q So, the summary of conclusions does not actually revert back to Hurricane Eta at all -- or Tropical Storm Eta at all? A No, sir. It does not. Q And going back to the February 11th partial denial letter that we went over together, does that denial letter discuss Hurricane Eta or Tropical Storm Eta at all? A No, it does not. Q Does it talk about or incorporate anywhere in the denial letter, anything regarding the "heavy corrosion in the ceiling electrical box and the cementitious repairs of the garage ceiling, the water intrusion has repeatedly occurred over a long-term period of years." That conclusion did not make it to the partial denial letter on February 11th, isn't that correct? A Not sure it's found in the exclusions cited. Q Okay. Cited in the exclusions but it's not stated as to why. Because I think it says here specifically, "We are unable to provide coverage for the tile repairs. We will extend coverage to solely repair the interior water damage sustained as a result of the leak." Let me just clarify that question. I apologize. The conclusion that I was looking for is here. The actual conclusion relied on in the letter, is the conclusion stated that there was a deficiency in the waterproofing layer cause damages to the tile, as well as ensuing water damage to the interior -inside of your home. The improper installation of the waterproofing layer falls under an exclusion on your policy. Isn't that correct? A That is correct. Q So, it doesn't say anything in that statement about long-term corrosion or long-term seepage. It does not say any of that. Is that correct? A It refers to the exclusions, which are understood based on his report to include that. Q So, Mr. Kirk, do you agree that they did open coverage to repair the box, the electrical box, right? A Yes. Q To properly repair the electrical box and to repair the drain that led to the electrical box, wouldn't Mr. Rothschild have to remove those tiles? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: No. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q He would not have to remove the tile to repair the drain or the -- whatever issue it was under, that caused that electrical box to short circuit? A If you'll go to the exclusions again. Now, you're in his report. There you go. Q Back to the report. Okay, back to here. A Okay. So, it says, "We don't provide coverage for the presence of wear and tear, gradual deterioration, rust, bacteria," et cetera. So, what the engineer has concluded is deficiencies in the waterproofing layer, not direct physical damage or loss. It is a gradual loss that has occurred over time that's allowed that water to penetrate that surface and ultimately leak to the garage underneath that plaza deck. Q Well, that's the engineer's opinion, but you did open coverage for the ensuing loss. And my question is, Mr. Rothschild didn't claim that the tile was damaged. That's not what he claimed, is it? A No. Q And is it -A And we're agreeing that the tile is not damaged. Q Well, isn't it Mr. Rothschild's claim that in order to properly repair what caused the loss that you've opened coverage for, the tile would have need to have been removed in order to get to that subsurface, isn't that true? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: No. The electrical box is below that. It's accessible through the garage. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q But you agree with me that in the report that we read in, it says that the waterproofing layer of the deck is not accessible with the wearing surface tile in place. Isn't that true? A That is correct. Q Okay. So, Mr. Rothschild would have need to repair anything on that sublayer, he would have had to remove that tile? A You'd have to have a cause of loss to access that. And there is no cause of loss to the tile. Q Well, it's not about the tile, what was damaged. But we're contending, is that in order to properly repair it, Mr. Rothschild needs to remove that title. A If you go back to the exclusions, again in our denial letter, it will explain why we're not presenting coverage for that. Q Okay, I'll take it. I understand you're not providing coverage for the loss. The engineer told you that based on his visual observation of staining, this was a leak that was occurring over a long period of time. Therefore, the underlayment and flashing must have been installed improperly. Isn't that a correct statement? A That is correct, which is an exclusion in our policy. Q All right. But that's not based on his actual knowledge. That's just based on his visual observation without actually removing any tile or reviewing the plans to see if they were done right, correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: Yes, I would agree with that. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q So, the only reason the engineer is assuming that the underlayment and construction of the underlayment was improper was because he saw stainage on the ceiling in the garage below, indicating a longterm seepage. Isn't that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form, asked and answered. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Isn't that correct, Mr. Kirk? A That's what we've previously established. And that's the only way to -Q I got it. A -- to prove logically that that's where the water is coming from. Q You would agree with me, Mr. Kirk, that inferencing something logically still circles around speculation? MR. HOLOBER: Form, outside of the scope. THE WITNESS: It's based on his knowledge and experience as an engineer. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q But you agreed with me earlier that there was no methodology implored within this report to determine or confirm his hunch, call it, that the staining was done over a specific period of time. You agreed with me on that, no? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: I agreed that staining could indicate, you know, any number of period of times, could be one, could be multiple. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Could have been a day, could have been a year, agreed?A Potentially, there was also evidence of a previous repair in that very area in the garage below.Q Did you see multiple pictures of the area below?A I believe they're in his report, yes.Q We're now looking down at the pictures of the report into the garage. We're looking at photograph 12. Would you agree that there's more than one water line in photograph 12, in the ceiling garage below, Mr. Kirk?A I'm not sure what those particular lines are. It looks like there's a fire suppression line which is painted red. There is a line in the middle, which is blue. I'm not sure what that is. And then there are other lines that appear to be drain lines. And whether those are sewer lines or surface water lines, I don't know.Q But you'll agree with me that there's multiple lines carrying water going across that ceiling. Isn't that correct, Mr. Kirk? A It would appear that's the case, yes.Q And you would agree that water follows the path of least resistance, Mr. Kirk?A Absolutely.Q And you would agree that aside, there is no methodology or testing in this report from Donan following any of these lines were trying to determine where any of this water could or could not have come from. Isn't that correct?A He could not have done that without destructive testing.Q Happy you said that. So, anything that they're looking at downstairs is purely speculative to the best of their ability, within their professional capacity?A Within their professional capacity, they drew logical conclusions that the water was leaking from above.Q Sure. All that water would have been leaking from above. But they didn't actually do anything besides look at the staining to make that determination. Is that correct, Mr. Kirk?MR. HOLOBER: Asked and answered. A That is correct. They're not authorized to perform destructive testing. Q They could have performed the other testing. A He was tempted to replicate the issue and it was not repeatable. Q Well, they didn't attempt to do that testing from any other location, right? Not according to the report anyway. MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: There would be no reason to do it from any other location. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Well, what about a thorough investigation, Mr. Kirk? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: The water is clearly staining that ceiling, align that pipe that is below the area in the plaza deck. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q But you agree with me that there's multiple water lines flowing within that same ceiling. Isn't that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Ask and answered. THE WITNESS: Those are exterior to the structure that the leak appears to be -- you moved off the picture, so I can't tell you what I was going to -MR. TIMLICHMAN: Sorry about that. I'm sorry. I don't know my -- I apologize for that. We were looking here. THE WITNESS: Right. We were looking right there that the leak is clearly not coming from that drain line. It's coming from -- it's visible on the ceiling in the wall that is above and behind the drain line. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q I agree with that statement. And for record purposes, we're looking at photograph 13. But Mr. Kirk, you earlier agreed with me that the engineer did not pull any of the plans or schematics of the building. So, you would agree that the engineer doesn't have the plumbing schematics of the building, do they? A He does not. Q Okay. So, he doesn't actually know what lines are running right above him, or to the side of him because it's covered by ceiling and the wall. Isn't that correct? A We're unaware that there's any plumbing lines running through the ceiling or the wall. Q Okay. So, wherever that water would have came from, it would have been a purely speculative question. Isn't that correct? A Based on his observations and the report, it logically has concluded that it was coming from the plaza deck above. Q Okay. Well, if I showed you, for example, if somebody showed you that water was running from one of those other lines -- and we agreed that water takes the path of least resistance -- and somehow in the cavity of the wall, that water made its way down because of the pitch, you would tell me that that's plausible, would you? MR. HOLOBER: Form. Hypothetical question. Instruct not to answer. Outside of scope. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q I'll rephrase it. Your engineers didn't test the pitch of the ceiling. Did they? A He ran a water test above it. Q But he didn't test the pitch, did he? A I don't understand the nature of the question. Q Does he know if that's a flat ceiling? Does he know if that ceiling's pitched? A Based on the photographs that I'm looking at, it looks like a level ceiling. Q Okay. But you would agree with me that your eye is not the best measure of what's level and what's not, right? A It can be deceived. Q Okay. And you would agree with me that even the slightest degree, any change in pitch would determine which way the water would flow, isn't that right? A Potentially, that's true. Q And you would agree with me that your engineer doesn't have actual knowledge as to where the drain in Mr. Rothschilds Plaza deck actually empties out to? A I don't believe that's true. Q Well, he doesn't have the piping schematic, does he? A I believe he's able to conclude that the pipe in the picture below, I believe that's photograph 14, is the drain pipe from the ceiling or the patio deck above. Q Well, why don't we read what he writes on the photograph below for photograph 14. Doesn't he say, "stains on the opposite side of the concrete beam?" A He does. Q So, isn't that the opposite side of the picture 13 that we were just looking at? A I don't know. I suppose so, yes. Q So, wouldn't that mean that that's coming now from -- wouldn't those stains now be coming from the adjoining unit because it's on the opposite side of the beam? A No, not necessarily. That that beam could be a structural beam underneath the plaza deck. Q Well, I appreciate how you answered that, Mr. Kirk, because what you just stated is not necessarily. So, you would agree with me that absent actually having the schematic and design of where that pipe flows to, you don't actually have actual knowledge as to where that drain line finishes up. And none of these photos actually state that that's where the drain line ended up, is it? A That is correct. Q But that information could have been available to them. Should they have sought that out? Wouldn't it have been? A I can agree with that. Q And you would agree with me that getting that information would have certainly added to this being a thorough investigation? A I can agree that it potentially added value. Q Okay. And you'll agree with me in photograph 7, the engineer actually does test the pitch of the deck. So, he had the tools to do so on site the day of the inspection, right? A Excuse me, that would appear to be correct. Q And you would agree with me that when you're looking at picture 8 versus picture 7, that picture 8 looks like a level floor, doesn't it? A Visually, I can see a little bit of a slope to it from my own observations and my own knowledge. But clearly, I've got information from photograph 7. Q Agreed. So, you would agree that the engineer could have easily taken his levels and very easily seen to the what the pitch of that ceiling below us. Isn't that correct? A He could have done that. Yes. Q And that too would have helped for a more thorough investigation? A It could have provided some additional information. Q Okay. I would like to now go back to our discussion about Hurricane Eta. This report states that Tropical Storm Eta made landfall in the United States on November 8, 2020. Is that correct? A That's what the report reflects. Q And again, just for clarity, your denial letter did not deny this claim because of Hurricane Eta, Tropical Storm Eta, or the weather conditions surrounding Hurricane Eta. Is that correct?A That is correct.Q You would agree with me that on November 20th -- I'm sorry, you would agree with me on November 25th, there was no more Hurricane Eta or Tropical Storm Eta?A That was the date of loss reported to us. I don't know how he came to that date.Q I mean again, respectfully, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Rothschild has stated in his deposition -- and I would imagine as the corporate rep that you would have been given that information, that the first time the cause of loss occurred was when the HOA brought it to his attention and that was on November 25th as stated in the many correspondences that we've gone through today. Is that correct?MR. HOLOBER: Form.THE WITNESS: Again, I've got to say that that's the date that it was reported to him and that's the date he's reported. Evidently, the loss occurred because he hadn't seen it himself previously. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q But you would agree he wasn't the one who saw it anyway, the HOA brought it to his attention? A Correct. So, it could have happened before that. Q Okay. A We don't know. Q Okay. And you would agree that in your report, your engineer realized that Eta resulted in 15 inches of rainfall in South Florida? A I wouldn't say we relied on that. It's information reported in there, but it's not in his conclusions. Q Well, actually, if we look in his conclusions, he says, "Although the water intrusion cannot be replicated during the study, heavy precipitation during November 8, 2020 Tropical Storm Eta provided sufficient precipitation for the water infiltration." So, going back to my question, you want to change your answer to maybe he did rely on that in his conclusion? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: Reading that again, I would say that it's stated in his conclusions. Yes. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q So, he's relying on the heavy precipitation that occurred on Hurricane Eta to explain why he couldn't replicate the water damage with the hose, so to speak? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: That's a conclusion you could draw, yes. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. Does this report do any analysis of the weather between November 8th and November 25th? A No, it does not. Q Does it look at the weather, for example, on November 10th, the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, any of those days? A There's nothing contained in the report that indicates as such. Q And would you agree if there were other days of heavy rainfall after Hurricane Eta, that that rainfall could have been the cause and not the rainfall from Hurricane Eta or Tropical Storm Eta, I apologize? MR. HOLOBER: Form. Outside the scope. MR. TIMLICHMAN: I disagree. That's very much within the scope. MR. HOLOBER: But you're asking him to speculate. MR. TIMLICHMAN: I'm not asking him to speculate. I'm asking him specifically, if there was any determination or any -BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Was there any effort placed by Chubb in their investigation to look at the weather or the rain between November 8th and November 25th, Mr. Kirk, your answer was none that you know of, correct? A That is correct. Q And we're discussing that your report relied on the heavy precipitation of rain from Hurricane Eta to be the reason as to why -- or one of the reasons as to why they could not replicate that water leak with the hose. Is that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: That would appear to be correct. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. So, my question then now is, if there was another day of heavy rainfall, could that other day of heavy rainfall have been the cause?MR. HOLOBER: Form. This is the (inaudible).MR. TIMLICHMAN: No. Answer, Mr. Kirk.THE WITNESS: Ultimately the cause is determined by deficiencies in the waterproofing layer, not a specific event. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q So, it's the insurances position that it has nothing to do with the tropical storm whatsoever that makes no difference in determination at all? A No, the determination was that there are deficiencies in the waterproofing layer. Q Okay. So, if Mr. Rothschild's able to prove that there were no deficiencies in the water laying underlayment, your position as stated today is Chubbs should cover and pay for the ensuing loss that resulted from it? A Well, we have already provided the ensuing coverage. Q It's not my question, Mr. Kirk. My question is if Mr. Rothschild is able to prove that the flashing and underlayment waterproofing was, in fact, not installed improperly, Chubb should provide coverage for the damage to the tiles for having to repair whatever caused that leak on that day? MR. HOLOBER: Form. Calls for a legal conclusion. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Mr. Kirk, you can respond. THE WITNESS: I think you need to go back to our exclusions and read the exclusions in their entirety as well, because wear and tear deterioration is also part of that very same exclusion. Deficiencies -- if it split, which, you know -- that the conclusion is that there were no openings in the tile that would allow water to otherwise come in. Therefore, there must be something wrong with the waterproofing layer. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. So, if there's nothing wrong with the waterproofing layer, then Chubb should not deny this claim in any part, agreed? A No, because there was some ensuing water damage and we cover ensuing water damage. Q That's not my question, Mr. Kirk. And I appreciate how you're trying to respond. I do. But I'm asking again, put the ensuing water damage to the side. Right now, we have a partial covered loss, you just stated on the record, that it's because the flashing and underlayment was not done properly. It was not installed properly. That is what stated in your denial letter. My question is, if Mr. Rothschild proves that there was no problem with the flashing or the underlayment, does Chubbs then now have to provide coverage for the entirety of the loss?MR. HOLOBER: Asked and answered.MR. TIMLICHMAN: Mr. Kirk, your answer.THE WITNESS: No, we do not. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Why?A Because there's evidently deficiencies in the waterproofing layer. We're relying our -Q But again -- hold on, Mr. Kirk. Let's take that a step back.A Well, you can't –Q You said that –A I'm sorry. That's all part and partial of the examination and evaluation.Q But now, you -- okay. So, again, let's go back to your denial letter. Where in your denial letter does it say that you're denying this claim because of long-term seepage or long-term leaking. Where does it say that?A It says it down in in the exclusion. It's all part of that.Q I understand what the exclusion says. I understand that. I understand your position is that it's part of that. My question --A A deficiency. A deficiency could be wear and tear. It could be improper installation. It could be faulty workmanship or maintenance. Q Okay. So, if there was no wear and tear issue, if there was no faulty maintenance, and if there was no issue in the waterproof layer, or improper installation of the waterproof layer, does Chubbs then need to come and provide coverage? A I'm going to state again, we have provided coverage for the ensuing water damage that resulted -as a result of a bypass in some sort of the system. Q Well, I'm asking you, based on your exclusion here, you do not cover loss caused by faulty acts, errors or omissions, construction, or maintenance. Let's say none of this exists here, okay? None of this is here. There's no issue in the construction materials. There's no issue in the workmanship. There's no issue in the equipment. There's no issue for faulty acts. There's no issue for omissions. There's no issue in the installation. There's no issue in the waterproofing. There's no signs of wear and tear. None of that exists. Does coverage now have to be fully provided? Yes or no. A If not -MR. HOLOBER: Form. I'm sorry, Kirk. Form and this calls for a legal conclusion. MR. TIMLICHMAN: He's the corporate representative. This is not a legal conclusion. I'm asking you a coverage question. And you have to be able to answer a coverage question because you represent the corporation. MR. HOLOBER: You're asking a point that he's able to prove all of these things and -MR. TIMLICHMAN: I'm not. I am asking you a very simple question. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q We have now discussed that your engineer made a finding based on his visual observation. He has never actually seen the underlayment. Here, we now have testimony that we know that Chubbs never had the benefit of seeing the plans. So, they cannot say with certainty that it was designed and installed improperly. Okay? MR. TIMLICHMAN: So, let me now open you up to my next exhibit -- A, B, C, D, E, F -Exhibit F. THE WITNESS: Before we go to that, can we take a quick 5-minute break? MR. TIMLICHMAN: Absolutely, Mr. Kirk. Would you like more than a 5-minute break? THE WITNESS: No, 5 minutes for me would be adequate. MR. TIMLICHMAN: And Debbie, how about you? Do you folks want to -- I would say I have about 45 minutes left with you, Mr. Kirk. And I'm sorry if that's running late on a Friday. THE WITNESS: No, that's okay. MR. TIMLICHMAN: If you folks -MR. HOLOBER: Can we have -MR. TIMLICHMAN: -- if you want a lunch break, if you want to take a 10-minute lunch, 15minute lunch? MR. HOLOBER: Yes, I want 10. REPORTER: Just a five. Five is good. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Debbie, you're good. MR. HOLOBER: Kirk, you're good with ten? THE WITNESS: Evan wants ten, I believe. MR. HOLOBER: Kirk, are you good with ten? THE WITNESS: Yes, ten's fine. I just desperately need to use the restroom. MR. TIMLICHMAN: All right. It's now 12:40. We'll see everyone back on the record at 12:50. REPORTER: Perfect. MR. HOLOBER: Okay. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Very good. REPORTER: Okay. We're off the record for 10 minutes at 12:39/12:40. (Recess) REPORTER: We are back on the record at 12:52. Please continue. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. I'm going to do a quick stop share. Mr. Kirk, we were discussing earlier that the report alludes to Hurricane Eta or Tropical Storm Eta, right?A Yes.Q Okay. On November 25th, there was no Tropical Storm Eta, right?A Established, yes.Q And on November 20th, there was no Hurricane Eta, right?A That is correct.Q And you agree with me that Great Northern or Chubb did no investigation as to the weather conditions between November 8th and 25th. A That would be correct. Q Have you had the opportunity to review the expert reports that the Plaintiff filed? A I'm not sure. Q You want to check your binder? A And what tab would that be in? Q Let me take a quick look. MR. HOLOBER: The expert reports were not sent to the binder. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Okay. Then I will reserve on asking those questions. MR. HOLOBER: Well, he has knowledge of the reports, but you're going to have to do a share screen. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Mr. Kirk, are you aware that the Plaintiff made a presentation that on November 13th, there was a heavy rainstorm not associated with Tropical Storm Eta? A I don't remember the specific details. You have something you can share to show me? Q Yes. Give me a second, let me get it up for you. A Thank you. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Okay. Mr. Kirk, I'm now going to share with you what has been previously marked as Exhibit -- E, F -- G. And this is a copy of a CompuWeather Forensic Weather report. (Exhibit G was marked for identification.) THE WITNESS: Okay. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Have you seen this report? A That was, I believe, sent to me yesterday for just review. I wasn't aware that we were going to talk about it today. Q That's okay. And I apologize to surprise you. But very simple question that I want to ask you here that I want you to just confirm with me. First of all, there's a question as to whether the incident occurred on November 20th or November 25th. I do believe the incident occurred on November 25th based on the correspondence between the client and Chubbs. Regardless, we asked the weather expert to look at it from November 20th forward. To that end, Mr. Kirk, can you please read the conclusion from this exhibit stated in paragraph 2? A Paragraph 2 reads, "Tropical Storm Eta was not affecting the region on November 20, 2020." Q And can you read paragraph 3? A "All National Weather Service watches and warnings associated with Tropical Storm Eta were canceled at 10:05 a.m. PST on November 9, 2020, 11 days prior to the date in question. There were no additional watches or warnings issued for Eta after this time."Q And at the bottom here, can you just say who it was prepared for? Who was it prepared by? I apologize, prepared by.A Okay. It was prepared by a gentleman by the name of James Bria, certified consulting meteorologist.Q And what does it say after that under title?A "CompuWeather Senior Forensic Meteorologist."Q Okay. So, you would agree with me, Mr. Kirk, that as long as Mr. Bria's certifications are valid and in good standing, he would be the proper party to make determinations and observations and findings as to weather, because he's a forensic meteorologist?A I would agree with that.Q Okay. And according to his conclusion here as of November 9, 2020, all Tropical Storm Eta warnings, watches were canceled at 10:05 a.m.A That's what his report indicates.Q Okay. And would it be fair to say that as of 10:05 a.m., on November 9, 2020, all insurance companies writing insurance in the region were writing policies again? MR. HOLOBER: Outside of the scope of the notice. MR. TIMLICHMAN: You can answer. MR. HOLOBER: He can testify as to all insurance companies. I mean, Kirk, to that extent that you know, go ahead. THE WITNESS: I wouldn't have knowledge of that specifically because I can't address, you know, all insurance companies and it would be a question for underwriting as to when we would resume. I wouldn't have knowledge for that. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q But you do sit here today and answer for the corporation, don't you? A I answer for the claims side of the corporation. Q And you were charged with knowledge of anything and everything to do with this claim, the claims handling, and the claims investigation of this claim. Isn't that true? A Claims specific, yes. But the question you asked would be underwriting in nature. I don't know 1 what -- when we would resume. And I certainly don't 2 know when other insurance carriers would resume. 3 Q But earlier, you testified that no insurance 4 company would write a policy during a named storm. 5 Isn't that true? 6 A That's common knowledge. 7 Q Okay. Well, would you agree that once the 8 storm is canceled and over, that they will start 9 writing policies again? 10 A One could infer that. I don't know for 11 sure. 12 Q Okay. I'll take that as an answer. And 13 according to this weather report, as of November 9, 14 2020, at 10:00 in the morning, Tropical Storm Eta was 15 no longer an issue for this region? 16 A It's what the report indicates, yes. 17 Q Okay. So, if there was an additional rain18 related event between November 9th and November 25th, 19 it would have been outside of Hurricane Eta or 20 Tropical Storm Eta. 21 A Correct. 22 Q And you agree that Great Northern Insurance 23 relied on the engineer's reliance -- in relying in the 24 report, they relied on the engineer's reliance of 25 Hurricane Eta's rainfall on November 8th. MR. HOLOBER: Asked and answered. THE WITNESS: I think he was trying to draw a conclusion as to where a potential volume of water may have come from to cause the issue to manifest itself. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q I understand. And you would agree with me that that observation was limited to his layman research of the weather as to November 8th and November 8th only? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: I believe that's his conclusion. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q I mean the report doesn't make reference to anything else, right? It doesn't make reference to any other days of weather whatsoever, right? MR. HOLOBER: Asked and answered. THE WITNESS: Yes, that's correct. We established that. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Apologize. Okay. That's all I needed from this report. We're getting into the home stretch, folks. So, and I just wanted to again clarify, rain is not an exclusion under the policy, right, Mr. Kirk? MR. HOLOBER: Asked and answered. THE WITNESS: That is correct. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Okay. Let's take a quick look at your affirmative defenses. And I think from there, we should be able to wrap up. All right. So, I'm now going to show you what has been previously marked as -- A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H -- previously marked as Exhibit H. And this is the Defendant's answer and affirmative defense. (Exhibit H was marked for identification.) BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q And Mr. Kirk, I'm now showing you what has been previously marked as Exhibit H. Can you please confirm whether this is an accurate version of the answer and affirmative defense? MR. HOLOBER: Can I see the whole document, Counsel? MR. TIMLICHMAN: Sure. If you need me to slow down the rolling, just let me know. MR. HOLOBER: Do back up. THE WITNESS: That appears to be consistent with the document I have, yes. MR. TIMLICHMAN: And Mr. Holober, are you satisfied with the document? MR. HOLOBER: Yes. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Okay. Great. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. So, Mr. Kirk, we're going to do a little discussion in terms of the affirmative defenses. And we'll go with the first one. So, is it accurate to say that the first affirmative defense within the policy relies on the exclusion for wind or hail? A Read the entire section here. Give me one moment. Q Take your time. A Yes, that is correct. Q What facts is Great Northern Insurance or Chubb relying on when they assert this affirmative defense?A The policy speaks for itself in this regard.Q But you agree with me that in the coverage denial letter, there's no mention of wind or hail. Isn't that correct?A It is correct. We acknowledge in the denial letter that this is a wind and hail excluded policy.Q Do you agree that there was no wind or hail created opening?A To the best of our knowledge, it does not appear that there was a wind or hail opening. Q And you agree that any rain damage was not the result of a direct force of wind or hail damage -damaging the building causing an opening in the roof or wall that would have allowed the rain or any other elements to seep through its opening? Is that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: We agree. We believe that it's a result of some deficiencies in the waterproofing layer. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q So, you agree that this affirmative defense is without any foundation? A We agreed that this policy is written as a wind and hail excluded event. We did not believe that it was relative to the findings. Q So, you agree, as you sit here now, that there is no wind or hail determination within this claim? Meaning it's not relevant to this claim. Wind or hail is not relevant to this claim. A We did not have wind or hail damage. That is correct. Q So, this claim is not being denied as part of Hurricane or Tropical Storm Eta. A That is correct. Q Okay. So, again, I ask you, Mr. Kirk, is it fair to say that affirmative defense number one lacks foundation? MR. HOLOBER: Calls for legal conclusion. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q You can respond, Mr. Kirk. A Based on your description and interpretation, I would say, yes, that is correct. Q Okay. Let's move on to affirmative defense number two. Affirmative defense number two seems to rely on two exclusions. Can we discuss what these two -- you agree that it again goes back to the wind and hail exclusion, which we've just determined, based on our discussion, lack of foundation, and then it goes into the gradual or sudden loss. Is that correct? A In this -MR. HOLOBER: This question calls for a legal conclusion regarding the way the affirmative defense is written. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Well, again, it's an affirmative defense. Mr. Kirk, you agree that this would have needed to be provided to Chubbs and Chubbs is really the one swearing to these affirmative defenses. Isn't that true?A You're misinterpreting the way it's read.Q Okay.A The exclusions in the policy -Q Please explain it to me.A The exclusions in the policies are all titled with this particular paragraph to start, then under that because this is a otherwise wind and hail excluded policy. And I believe you were provided a copy of the policy. If you look, it will show the title exclusions, just general paragraph and then, each specific exclusion that bars coverage.Q Understood. So, the affirmative defense for number two is specific only to gradual or sudden loss?A That is correct.Q What facts are they relying on? What facts -- I'm sorry, strike my question. What facts is Great Northern Insurance relying on in making its determination that this claim is barred because of the gradual or sudden loss exclusion?A Now, if you read the gradual or sudden loss exclusion, it says, "We do not provide coverage for the presence of wear and tear, gradual deterioration -" 1 Q Mr. Kirk, not to be rude, I apologize. I'm 2 going to ask to strike your response is non3 responsive. And I'm only doing this because I want to 4 get us out of here a little early. But my specific 5 question is not what does the policy language say -- I 6 agree with you that it speaks for itself. My specific 7 question is what facts is Great Northern Insurance 8 relying on in presenting that exclusion? 9 A We're relying on the facts presented in the 10 engineer's report that indicate that there is probable 11 wear and tear deterioration and rust that involves 12 this loss. 13 Q And for clarity, this is going now back to 14 the Donan report that we discussed, correct? 15 A Correct. 16 Q So, you're relying on the observations made 17 by the engineer and the conclusions made by the 18 engineer in which he states that "Based on the 19 staining on the garage ceiling below, rainwater is 20 migrating through the plaza," dot, dot, dot. "And 21 then based on the heavy corrosion in the ceiling 22 electrical box and cementitious repair of the garage 23 ceiling, the water intrusion has repeatedly occurred 24 over a long-term period of years." Is that correct? 25 Is that the facts that you are relying on from within the report in asserting that affirmative defense, Mr. Kirk? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: That is correct. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Are there any other facts aside from those observations and the Donan report that Great Northern Insurance is relying on in asserting that affirmative defense? A We are relying on these conclusions of the engineer. Q Okay. So, there are no other facts or reports or circumstances aside from this report, the Donan report, for the assertion of exclusion number -I apologize, for affirmative defense number two relying on the wear and tear exclusion. Is that correct? And I'm saying that not to be redundant. Let me preface it by saying I want to basically make sure that there's nothing else we need to be discussing that the insurance company, no other document, no other inspection, no other piece of information that Great Northern is relying on in coming to the affirmative defense of wear and tear. A We are relying on the report provided by the Donan engineer. Q Okay. And for clarity, and I apologize if this is redundant, but I needed for this part of the depo. The scope of work does not actually ask the engineer to make a determination of long-term seepage or wear and tear. Isn't that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Asked and answered, close to ten times on this one. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Mr. Kirk, you can respond. And Mr. Holober, as much as I like you, I would ask that you please refrain from stepping into the realm of doing your speaking objections. You're becoming a little bit more liberal with them again. MR. HOLOBER: I don't believe I am, but you're objection is -BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. Mr. Kirk, please give me an answer. Let me make it simpler. The scope of this report is not to determine wear and tear and long-term seepage. Isn't that correct? A The scope of the report was to determine how the water was intruding into the patio. And his conclusions draw wear and tear. Q Okay. But the wear and tear has nothing to do with cause, right? You can discuss cause without wear and tear, isn't that right? A Not necessarily, no. Q That's not my question. Again, you can discuss cause -- not necessarily means yes. So, you can discuss cause without discussing wear and tear. Isn't that right? A Not if part of -- not if the cause is determined to be a result of wear and tear and longterm deteriorations. Q Well, let me ask you a question. How does the cause of water intrusion determine whether it was long term in nature? Mr. Kirk, can you give me an example of that? A That's an opinion that the engineer has drawn and provided. Q So, is he suggesting that because the water intrusion was -- oh, okay, I understand. So, what you're saying is because there was wear and tear, there was water intrusion. Is that what you're suggesting? A That and probable installation deficiencies. Q I understand. Okay. What exactly is he claiming was being wear and tear, so to speak? What specifically failed? What components is he now saying failed for this cause, for the water intrusion? What worn and torn, in essence? What is it? What specific mechanical or piping or fitting was worn and torn that caused the water intrusion through the patio to the parking garage? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: He opines that it was the waterproofing layer that had a deficiency. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Well, is it a deficiency or is it that there was gradual deterioration? A The deficiency can be gradual deterioration. It could be wear and tear. It could be faulty installation. It could be any number of those things. Q So, is it your testimony that Great Northern doesn't know specifically which one of those things that you just listed it is, but it has to be one of those? Is that what Great Northern is saying? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: We know specifically that there was no wind or hail or any kind of damage created opening. Therefore, based on the engineer's conclusions, it must be that we have a deficiency in the waterproofing layer via installation, age, wear and tear, deterioration, et cetera. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: 1 Q But you couldn't pinpoint exactly which one 2 of those it is, could you? 3 A Because we didn't open it up, because we 4 don't do destructive testing, because that would 5 introduce damage. 6 Q Because you didn't see it, right, Mr. Kirk? 7 A Correct. That's correct. 8 Q You would have need to see it to make that 9 determination. Isn't that correct? 10 A No, the engineer can draw those conclusions 11 based on his experience and training. 12 Q Well, wouldn't you agree that actual 13 knowledge is what -- I'm talking about when saying 14 seeing it versus something that he's speculating to. 15 Whether he's drawing it based on his knowledge and 16 experience, put that to the side. Okay, granted. 17 He's doing it based on his knowledge and experience, 18 fine. But wouldn't you agree with me, Mr. Kirk, that 19 without actually seeing it with his own eyes, he 20 doesn't have actual knowledge as to what the issue is, 21 whether it was deteriorated, whether it was installed 22 improperly? Isn't that correct? Without actually 23 seeing it, he lacks actual knowledge. Isn't that a 24 fair statement? 25 MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: No, I disagree 100 percent. I don't have to know the stove is going to burn me if I touch it if it's hot. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Well, wouldn't you have to -- but I think that's not a good example, Mr. Kirk. A No, it is. Because we would have had prior experience or an indication somebody told me, "Don't touch the stove because it's hot." Q That's not -A So, his training and expertise and qualifications provide him the ability to present this opinion based on other studies that he may have seen in similar circumstances. Q So, Mr. Kirk, well, wouldn't that be a statistical question and not an actual question? Because you're telling me that it could have been a maintenance issue. You're telling me it could have been a gradual deterioration. You're telling me that it could have been installed wrong. So, you're giving me four or five different conclusions. You're agreeing with me that you're not giving me one definitive conclusion as to why this thing failed, right? A There's more than one of those in our exclusions. Q I understand. But you're not giving me a specific reason. Isn't that correct? A I'm giving -- there's no opening. Therefore, it has to be a result of. Q Well, I'm asking you again. Well, hold on a second. Well, what happens if there was more water than that pipe could have taken on at one time? Could that not have been a cause? A It's not an opening. Q Well, what happen -A That's still -- that's a failure to deficiency. Q Why is that a deficiency? What happens if everything worked perfectly? That nothing broke down, but simply more rainwater at one time? Would you agree with me, Mr. Kirk, that sometimes and especially in South Florida, we receive heavy rainfall in short periods of time? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: Certainly. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. And would you agree that drains have a certain amount of water, they're meant to take per second for it to properly drain and flow? Would you agree with that statement? A I would believe that that's common knowledge. Yes. Q Okay. So, if there was an hour or two in a day between November 9th and November 25th, where buckets of rain was coming down for a short period of time, could that not have caused a drainage leak? MR. HOLOBER: Form. Hypothetical. THE WITNESS: I was going to ask it. Do you know of a date between the 9th and the 20th -or 25th that that could have happened? BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q I do. I do, Mr. Kirk. But I can tell you that Great Northern didn't take the steps to figure that date out, did they? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: It's not material to the investigation. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Well, wouldn't that have made for a more thorough investigation to know all the rainfall events? I mean you're sitting here and you're telling me, Mr. Kirk, politely with a straight face. You're giving me five different things that could have been wrong with this. And you're saying, "It has to be one 1 of those." And in your mind, that equals actual 2 knowledge. Isn't that correct? 3 MR. HOLOBER: Form. 4 THE WITNESS: There is no -5 MR. TIMLICHMAN: Isn't -6 THE WITNESS: There's no -7 BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: 8 Q Isn't the insured entitled to a specific 9 denial, explaining to him why he's being denied as to 10 whether it's a hurricane? Is it a hurricane opening 11 or is it wear and tear or is it that it was installed 12 properly or is Mr. Rothschild supposed to guess and 13 figure it out? 14 MR. HOLOBER: Form. 15 THE WITNESS: If there's no hole or 16 opening created as a result of the storm, it has to be 17 a deficiency in the installation or in the materials 18 or a latent defect in the product. 19 BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: 20 Q Mr. Kirk, but that's not true. Isn't it 21 maybe that Chubbs wants it to be a deficiency so they 22 can exclude coverage? 23 MR. HOLOBER: Form. 24 BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: 25 Q Because they don't know that -- Mr. Kirk, can you at least agree with me that all of their reasoning -- this whole report is speculative in nature? Can you not agree with that here and now? A No, sir. I do not agree with that. MR. HOLOBER: Form. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q All right. Listen, if you want to go in front of a jury with that. I'm okay with that, Mr. Kirk. I absolutely am. We could talk in circles about it all day. But it doesn't change the fact that you are here testifying today, five different things off of an exclusion list that it may be and trying to state to me that that is sufficient for a denial. Is that true? MR. HOLOBER: Form. And we're given harassment now. MR. TIMLICHMAN: I disagree. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Mr. Kirk, do you feel harassed? A Truthfully, yes, I do. And we did not -- we did not fully deny the claim. We offered a partial coverage for the ensuing water damage. Q But Mr. Kirk, you don't really know what is wrong with the underlayment or the flashing, do you? A Without tearing it up, we can't be for sure. Q Okay. So, you based your denial based on assumption. Isn't that true? A We based our denial on the professional opinion of a qualified engineer. Q Was he qualified to make a statement about the stainage? A It's an observation. Q Okay. And what was that observation based on? His visual observation? I asked you earlier if there was any methodology that he implored to come to a determination as to his conclusion as to the longterm seepage. You weren't able to articulate any methodology to that. Are you telling me that there's some methodology that we didn't discuss or can you admit here and now that it's just based on his eyeball visualization? MR. HOLOBER: Form. Asked and answered. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Mr. Kirk, you can answer. A It's based on his accumulative knowledge and skill as a professional engineer, and we've relied on the findings that he's presented. Q Well, let me ask you a question, Mr. Kirk. If you have a heart attack and you go to the heart doctor, the doctor looks at you and says, "Well, it's probably because you're overweight." Does the inquiry stop there? Do you do an MRI and a CAT scan and an X-ray? MR. HOLOBER: Outside the scope. I instruct him not to answer. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q It's okay. So, going back to your affirmative defense, your denial letter -- nowhere in your denial letter, except for the inclusion of this paragraph, is there any discussion about wear and tear, about long-term seepage or deterioration? Is that correct? Aside from the inclusion of this paragraph taken right out of the policy, nowhere in your letter do you articulate facts explaining to Mr. Rothschild what within this exclusion is actually the cause? Is that correct? A We don't cite a specific cause out of that list of probable causes. Q Okay. Okay. I appreciate you saying the list of probable causes. And you agree with me that the Donan report that you rely on makes observation, not rooted in methodology but rooted in as you called it, "the engineer's knowledge and experiences" as to the stainage and the repeated seepage observations that he made in his report. Is that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. Asked and answered. THE WITNESS: He makes his observations. Of course, you know, the word observation, hence he seen it with his eyes, but it's relative to his knowledge of construction of a plaza deck. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. And I'm going to ask you one last question on this. Are you familiar with any testing methodology or licensing or anything, background, that would give -- is there a specialty out there? Is there an expert specialist that you can call to go do an observation or testing on stainage to determine the length of time or duration of something based on the coloration of the stain? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: There may be an expert out in the industry. I, personally, I'm not aware of one. But given the necessity, we could find one, I'm sure. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. But this engineer is not qualified for that. Isn't that correct? A I don't know whether he is or not. Q It's certainly not within the scope of what the report called for. It didn't specifically call for him to do that kind of analysis or observation. Isn't that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Asked and answered. Form. THE WITNESS: That is correct. But he provided his opinion. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. Unasked opinion. Okay. Let's go to the third affirmative defense. So, here it seems that there is an exclusion in whole or in part for surface water, runoff water or waterborne material from a paved surface, driveway, walkway, patio, or other similar surface. Is that correct? A That is correct. Q Did you include this exclusion within your February 11th denial letter? A Unfortunately, no. And I wish we had, and we should have because it's relevant to the loss. Q What facts are you relying on when you state that runoff water or waterborne material from the paved surface, driveway, walkway, patio, or other similar surface was what occurred here? Show me where those facts are. MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: Well, you're familiar with how the building is laid out. This is an open patio exposed to the sky. Water would have gotten in there from an accumulation on -- in this case, a walkway because that patio or that -- gosh, what? I just lost it in my head. What do we call this? A plaza deck -MR. TIMLICHMAN: Plaza deck. THE WITNESS: -- is exposed to the sky. So, it's going to get runoff from the various walkways in itself. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Where in this report that you relied on in your denial letter does Donan make that observation or come to that conclusion? A We know how it's constructed from a previous inspection. Q What's constructed from a previous inspection, Mr. Kirk? A The patio, the -- god, why do I keep forgetting that thing? Q Plaza deck. A The plaza deck is exposed to the air and the elements. Q I'm asking you where, in this report does Donan talk about surface water or runoff water being the cause of this loss? A He does not speak of it. It's understood by the nature of the construction that that is a likely probability. Q Where is that understood? Was that presented in the denial letter or is that being presented here for the first time today, based on your opinions? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: It's presented as part of our affirmative defenses. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Well, can you please articulate where are those facts are written here? Because I see the inclusion of the paragraph, but I don't see any facts stating that water accumulated on Mr. Rothschild's plaza deck and created this loss. A So, if water had not accumulated on the plaza deck, it wouldn't have dripped to the garage below. Q Well, I think that you guys felt that had the water proofing and underlayment build installed 1 properly, then the water would have not slipped down 2 below. Isn't that why you denied the coverage? 3 A That was the letter that was written by the 4 claim rep at the time, yes. 5 Q Okay. So, I'm going to ask you again, Mr. 6 Kirk. When you file an affirmative defense, you have 7 to articulate specific facts, not assumptions. What 8 facts are you relying on that water runoff or surface 9 water was the cause of loss here? 10 MR. HOLOBER: Form. Calls for legal 11 conclusion. 12 MR. TIMLICHMAN: That's not a legal 13 conclusion. That's the wrong objection. 14 BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: 15 Q Mr. Kirk, you can answer. 16 MR. HOLOBER: I disagree. You asked, 17 you made a statement about affirmative defenses. 18 MR. TIMLICHMAN: No, I asked about the 19 facts around the affirmative defenses, Mr. Holober. 20 Please, no speaking objections. 21 BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: 22 Q Mr. Kirk, again, what facts -- actual facts, 23 not your opinion or your assumption. What facts are 24 you relying on in saying that runoff water or borne 25 water material from a pave surface caused this damage? A That's where the water comes from. Q Okay. You would agree with me that you're not an engineer, right? A I am not an engineer. Q All right. And you rely on an engineer's report because you can't testify or form opinion as the things that would require an engineer's opinion. Isn't that correct? A That is correct. Q And in your Donan report, you agree that nowhere in this report does it mention surface water or runoff water anywhere. Isn't that correct? A That is correct. Q And in this report, Donan's engineer in fact relies on the 15 inches of rainfall in South Florida in making the determination of where this water came from. Isn't that correct? A Again, I have to believe that he opines that that is a possible or probable source of a volume of water. Q Mr. Kirk, are you now speculating as to what the engineer's conclusion was that is not stated within the report? A No. Q Because that's what sounds like you're doing. A No, that's not what I'm doing. I'm saying that he relied on his knowledge. He says that a volume of water somewhere, somehow has to get onto this to have caused part of this issue. Q Well, doesn't he say that the water intrusion cannot be replicated when he ran a hose according to you for 15 minutes? So, would have that have created a pool of water or surface water? Wouldn't that have created that same setting that we're now discussing, within 15 minutes of running a hose on a plaza deck, create enough water to accumulate surface water and runoff water? Mr. Kirk, wouldn't that be enough time? A I don't know. Q Okay. And wouldn't he have written that in his report, in his conclusion or doesn't his report here say that, "Although the water could not be replicated, heavy precipitation during November 8, 2020, Tropical Storm Eta provided sufficient precipitation for water infiltration." That statement does not say anything about water runoff, does it? A It does not. Q Okay. So, any communication regarding water runoff is based on your opinion as you sit here today, not based on any discussion you've had with the engineer, and not based with anything written within this report. Isn't that correct? A That is correct. Q Okay. And within the answer and affirmative defense, there is no actual facts articulated aside from the inclusion of this paragraph to support runoff water or waterborne material from the pave surface. Isn't that correct, Mr. Kirk? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: I'd have to agree it's not contained in the report. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Or contained within the affirmative defenses. Do you see facts in this paragraph that I'm not reading that tend to support this conclusion? Anywhere in these -- one, two, three -- four sentences, are there any facts relied on or articulated to support the inclusion of a surface water exclusion from this claim? A Not in those sentences, no. Q Okay. But wouldn't they have had to have been there to put Mr. Rothschild on notice as to what facts Chubb is relying on in asserting this exclusion? Isn't that how it works, Mr. Kirk? MR. HOLOBER: It calls for a legal conclusion. Form. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q You can answer, Mr. Kirk. A I don't know. Q You earlier testified that insurance companies have an obligation and duty in the state of Florida to look at claims with the eye of coverage. Are you now saying that's not the case, Mr. Kirk?MR. HOLOBER: Form.THE WITNESS: No, that's not what I'm saying. And we did extend coverage. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Okay. So, wouldn't part of that last statement, for looking for coverage, the obligations to look for coverage in the state of Florida, wouldn't that also require you to articulate specifically why you're denying a claim? Isn't that why insurance companies are obligated to provide denial letters?MR. HOLOBER: Form.THE WITNESS: We provided the denial letter based on the information that we had. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Not my question, Mr. Kirk.MR. HOLOBER: Harassment. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Mr. Kirk, you're not answering my question. I asked you a very specific question. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Madam Court Reporter, is there any way for you to read back my question? REPORTER: Hold on. (Recess) BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Aren't the reason that you provide denial letters because you have to specifically articulate why you're denying a claim? A Yes, we -- that's what we did in the letter. Q Okay. But the letter makes no communication regarding surface water whatsoever? A That is correct. Q And this paragraph states, no facts articulating why surface water would have even been an issue. A In context, you are correct. Q Okay. Looking at the fourth affirmative defense. Chubb relies on the faulty planning construction or maintenance exclusion, that they "do not cover any loss caused by faulty acts, errors or omissions, or you or any other person in planning, construction, or maintenance." Okay. So, my first question, Mr. Kirk, are there any facts in this paragraph that address that anyone had any faulty acts at all? Does this paragraph make that claim? Does this say that Mr. Rothschild, or somebody within the building or a contractor submitted faulty acts or errors or omissions or any other precedent claim? Does it articulate those facts within this paragraph? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: Faulty planning, construction, or maintenance would indicate that there was an error or deficiency somewhere in that waterproofing layer. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Does it say that in that affirmative defense? A It says we do not cover any loss caused by the faulty acts, errors or omissions by you or any other person in planning, construction, or maintenance. Q But it doesn't identify who that person would have been for what that issue would have been. Isn't that correct? A It's clear. It says -- it speaks for itself. It says "by you or any other person in planning, construction or maintenance." Q Mr. Kirk, hold on a second. I understand what it says. But I'm asking you, does it specifically articulate who that person may be? A No, it does not. No, it doesn't. Q And does it articulate what that error or omission was, specifically? I understand what it says generally. I'm asking you specifically, does it actually address what error or omission or improper planning or what improper construction or maintenance took place or does it just generally state it? A It just generally states it. Q So, it doesn't say who committed the omission or error and it doesn't state what the omission or error is. Is that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: It goes back to the conclusions. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q But in this affirmative defense, Mr. Kirk, what I'm asking you is, does it articulate who committed this faulty act or error or omission? Yes or no. A I believe we've answered that already. No. Q Okay. And does it state what that error or omission or faulty construction or maintenance was? A It does not. Q Okay. A It says it does not matter whether the faulty acts, errors or omissions take place on or off the insured property. Q Well, does it say that? Do the facts articulate whether it took place on or off the property, by the way? Does it even make that specification? A The facts in the engineer's report do. Q What about in the denial? Does it articulate any of these facts within the denial letter? A Without having the denial letter up again, I can't recall off the top of my head. Q Let's get the denial letter up. So, looking back at the denial letter, does it articulate in the denial letter anywhere who committed these faulty acts, what these faulty acts were, and whether they occurred on or off the site? A I'm not seeing your screen. Q Oh, I apologize. I'm sitting here looking at my screen. There you go, Mr. Kirk. We're looking right back at the report. Does that articulate anywhere who committed these faulty acts? A Okay. Hold it right there. Q Okay. A And if you can move it to the left a little bit on the screen. Q To the left? A Mm-hmm. There, thank you. It says, "The conclusion stated that a deficiency in the waterproofing layer caused by damages to the tile, as well as the ensuing water damages," et cetera. So, there is a deficiency. And therefore, it must be faulty planning, construction, or maintenance. Q Okay. So, now, let's look at the report. Anywhere in this report, does it articulate specifically what the deficiency is or where the deficiency is or who committed the deficiency? A It says, "It is an installation deficiency in a waterproofing layer and/or wall flashing. Q Does it explain what within the installation specifically was done wrong? A No, it does not. Q Does the report rely on the actual engineering drawings and plans in coming to its conclusion? A It relies on the opinion of the engineer. Q Which is based upon what? A His observations and knowledge. Q But not the actual schematics, designs, the drawings, the permanent drawings, or the actual visualization of the actual underlayment below it, correct?A That is correct. We previously established that.REPORTER: Excuse me. I'm so sorry, I have to interrupt. I think I dropped my -- backup recorder dropped off the call. If you can just take one break, 1 minute. It won't take about a minute to get it back on.MR. TIMLICHMAN: No problem at all. I'm almost done too, so -REPORTER: We're off the record at 1:43.(Recess)REPORTER: Back on the record at 1:45. Please continue. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Okay. So, going back, we were discussing affirmative defense number 4. And just for confirmation, again, we were going to look at the denial letter to determine whether anywhere in the denial letter Chubbs actually articulates who had committed the error or where the error had been made. And I believe you had agreed that those facts were not present. And from there, I was asking you -- so, I think our questions left off where I asked you, what were the engineer's observations based off of? So, Mister -A Correct. And I believe I stated that it was, you know, based on his knowledge and experience and training as a professional engineer. Q Okay. And that's based off of his visual observations, not actually based on any testing or approved methodology within the region. Is that correct? MR. HOLOBER: Asked and answered. THE WITNESS: There was certainly no destructive testing done. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Was there any testing done? A Observations. Q When you say "observations," can we agree that observations means his visual observation and nothing more? A Yes, that would be correct. Q Okay. And we agree that this letter doesn't articulate any facts specifically articulating, you know, what faulty acts, errors or omissions or what person in planning or construction or maintenance committed these faulty acts. Those facts are not present in this letter.MR. HOLOBER: Form.THE WITNESS: Those are stated as conclusions. Again, it would be based on his observations. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Got it. Okay. Let's move on to the fifth affirmative defense. The fifth affirmative defense is based on structural movement, that Chubbs does not cover "any loss to additions and alterations of the condominium unit caused by the setting cracking, shrinking, bulging or expansion of bulkheads, pavements, patios, landings, steps, footings, foundations, walls, floors, roofs or ceilings or loss to glass as part of a building storm door or storm window, except loss caused by catastrophic ground cover collapse as provided under extra coverages. But we do ensure ensuing covered loss unless another exclusion applies."Why is Chubbs introducing a structural movement exclusion, Mr. Kirk? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: This is something that also should have been included in the partial denial letter, because it is likely concluded that that the damage is also contributed by settling, cracking, shrinking, bulging, et cetera, of this patio, so to speak, that would have contributed to the wear and tear, deterioration of the underlayment below. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q What facts are you relying to say that there was cracking, shrinking, bulging, setting or expansion of bulkheads? Okay. What facts are you relying on them? A The engineer's report talking about -- what was that part in there? I'm sorry, I forgot. It's talking about the structure, the way that the plaza deck is constructed. Q Show me specifically which paragraph it says that in. A I believe -- I don't know that it specifically says that. I think it would be an inference in the way that it's built. And that it is probable that structural movement could have occurred. Q Where in his conclusion does he say structural movement occurred? A He does not say that. Q Where in his summary of conclusions does he say that there was structural movement or issue? A He does not say that. Q You earlier testified that this engineer is in fact a structural engineer, didn't you? A That's my understanding. Yes, sir. Q So, he would be the best person to ask about structural issues? A Yes, sir. Q Yet he did not make any of those findings in his report? A No, sir. He did not. Q And you folks did not articulate any facts within your affirmative defense to support why this was here? A I believe it's a logical conclusion. Q Mr. Kirk, I respectfully ask that you answer my question. Are there any facts within the affirmative defense articulating why structural movement would be included as an exclusion? A There are no facts stated in the report. Q Okay. What about in the actual pleading, in the answer and affirmative? It doesn't say that somebody observed cracking on the plaza deck, right? A That's correct. Q Doesn't say that the plaza deck seemed to shift over a couple of inches, right? A No, but it would be something that that could have contributed to the issue. Q Well, a lot of things could have contributed. An earthquake could have contributed to the issue. But there wasn't an earthquake on the day, just like there are no facts written in this affirmative defense to provide my client an ample opportunity to defend against those claims, is there, Mr. Kirk? MR. HOLOBER: Form. THE WITNESS: There is none. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q Okay. So, you would agree with me that at the time of asserting this affirmative defense, those facts weren't present. Otherwise, they would have put it in here. A I have to conclude that. Q Okay. Sixth affirmative defense says, "Damage to outside structures, that we do not cover any loss caused by freezing, thawing or the pressure or weight of water, ice, or snow, whether driven by wind or not to any fence, arbor, pavement, patio, landing, or step, footing, foundation, wall, or any other structure device that supports all or part of your condominium unit. However, we do insure ensuing covered loss unless another exclusion applies."Same questions. Are there any articulated facts within this affirmative defense to support why damage to outside structures is being included as an affirmative defense?A No, sir.Q Do those facts or does this exclusion even exist inside the February 11th denial letters?MR. HOLOBER: Form.THE WITNESS: It does not. BY MR. TIMLICHMAN:Q Does the Donan report even discuss any observation to anything listed within the damage to outside structure exclusion?A It does not.Q Is it in the summary of conclusions in any way?A It is not.Q So, you would agree with me that the sixth affirmative defense equally lacks any foundation?A I would.MR. TIMLICHMAN: Okay. With that being said, Mr. Kirk, I am done with my inquiry of you today. I am sorry if I made you feel harassed. I thank you for your unbelievable professionalism, your patience throughout, especially for me, because Lord knows my wife has lost that patience for me a long time ago. I do appreciate the time we spent here today. And I hope that after today, the corporation, through you, can reassess their position of this claim. And Mr. Holober, if you have any questions for the kind gentleman? MR. HOLOBER: Yes. And I have a question for you, Joe. I'm going to refer to the complaint, the answer and affirmative defenses and the engineering report. Those are already in the record, except for the complaint. I believe we all have copies of those. Do you need me to do a screen share or am I okay to just refer to them? MR. TIMLICHMAN: No, you can refer to them. I mean if there's going to be like, very specific language that you're relying on, I would ask that we be able to see it. You know, I can always pull it up if you don't want to share it. But if it's not going to be based on very specific language, I don't mind you referring to them generally. MR. HOLOBER: I am going to do one specific reference in the complaint. But I know you didn't introduce that as an exhibit. So, I'm just trying to simplify the exhibit process. MR. TIMLICHMAN: I understand. EXAMINATION BY MR. HOLOBER: Q Okay. I've heard you have a copy of the complaint in front of you, right? A Yes, sir. Q And can you turn to page 2 of the complaint? And can you read paragraph 8? A This is under the heading "Factual allegations common to all counts," paragraph number 8. "On or about November 8, 2020, the Plaintiff suffered a fortuitous loss covered by the policy, namely windstorm damage, resulting in precipitation from Tropical Storm Eta." Q And so, we had referred to the answer and affirmative defenses. I'm now switching over. And affirmative defense one very specifically, refers to wind or hail, correct? A Yes. Q So, affirmative defense one would seem to be a response to the allegations in paragraph 8, correct? A Yes. Q And as we've established, there's nothing in the record indicating the Tropical Storm Eta caused damage to the patio, correct? A That's correct. Q Okay. I am now going to turn to the Donan report, which again, I believe we all have in front of us. Page 17, I'm looking specifically at photographs 17 and 18. Do you have that in front of you? A Which tab is that in, please? MR. TIMLICHMAN: I could do a screen share if it makes it easier. MR. HOLOBER: I can do a screen share. I've got it right here. I think we can stick it like that this is the same document that's already been entered into the record, right? MR. TIMLICHMAN: Yes, just as long as -Madam Court Reporter, you should be relying on our exhibit number for the purpose of this. MR. HOLOBER: Yes, I didn't write down what the exhibit number was. I think we can -MR. TIMLICHMAN: It's either Exhibit D or E, Madam Court Reporter. REPORTER: You want to know right now? MR. TIMLICHMAN: No, we can clarify that later, it's not -MR. HOLOBER: Yes, it's okay. I just want the record to show that this is already in the record, but we don't need to do a separate exhibit form. REPORTER: Okay. Perfect. BY MR. HOLOBER: Q Do you see the caption of photograph 17? A Yes, I do. Q What's the caption? A It says, "Cementitious material applied around the floor drain." Q Do you see paragraph 18? A Yes, sir. I do. Q Do you see the caption of photograph 18? A It reads "Cementous repair." Q Do you see any indications of possible cracking in photograph 17 or 18? A They would have been covered up by a previous repair. MR. TIMLICHMAN: I'm just going to object to form. BY MR. HOLOBER: Q So, it's likely that there is a crack under the prior repair. Is that what you're saying? MR. TIMLICHMAN: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: It is possible. BY MR. HOLOBER: Q I did not hear the response. I think we cut out there for a second. REPORTER: He froze. MR. TIMLICHMAN: He said, "It is possible," and then froze. REPORTER: Which means he's probably going to drop off. MR. HOLOBER: Wait for a moment. REPORTER: Mr. Killer?. MR. HOLOBER: What? REPORTER: Let's stop the recording for a moment until he gets -MR. HOLOBER: Oh, there we go. I think we can -REPORTER: Oh, there we go. Okay. MR. HOLOBER: -- move on. REPORTER: Okay. MR. TIMLICHMAN: And he's back. BY MR. HOLOBER: Q Kirk, can you hear me? A Yes, I can hear you. Q Okay. So, I did not quite catch your response to the last question about whether or not there appears to be potential cracking under the repair.MR. TIMLICHMAN: Objection. Just same objection, I apologize.THE WITNESS: Yes, my response is that it appears possible that there was cracking because this is a repair. BY MR. HOLOBER:Q Okay. So, I'm going back up to the conclusions on the report, and I'm looking specifically at the final paragraph. I've got it up on the screen here. The first paragraph under conclusions, do you see that?A Yes, sir.Q Can you see the second sentence there where it says "heavy precipitation during November 8, 2020, Tropical Storm Eta provided sufficient precipitation for the water infiltration?"A Yes, sir.Q Does that paragraph speak to a buildup of water on the patio?A It does.MR. TIMLICHMAN: Going to object.MR. HOLOBER: I believe that that is the end of my questioning. MR. TIMLICHMAN: Just one. Can you pull that back up? MR. HOLOBER: Yes, I got it right here. FURTHER EXAMINATION BY MR. TIMLICHMAN: Q My only follow up question, Mr. Kirk. It doesn't actually say that in the report, though, right? You're just making an inference? A It's a logical conclusion, but it does not say it in the report. Q I get it. And this was a structural engineer that wrote this report, isn't it? A That is correct. Q So, if it was really crucial, he would have known to put it in there?
