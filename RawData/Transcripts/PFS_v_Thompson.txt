Q. Mr. Thompson, good morning.A. Good morning. Q. How are you doing today? A. Good. Q. All right. So starting off, you understand my name is Brent Turman, and I represent Primerica? A. Correct. Q. Have you ever been deposed before? A. No. Q. Okay. So before we get started then, I will talk about some ground rules because this is very different from a normal conversation. So, first off, I am guilty of this sometimes but we're going to do our best not to speak over each other. So if you could please wait until I'm done asking my question to answer them, I will do my best to wait until you're done answering them to ask my next question; is that fair? A. Yes. Q. And if we ever have trouble with that, we will be reminded. After that I would ask you to make oral answers only. You're doing a great job, but the court reporter can't pick up shaking or nodding your head or uh-huh. A. Okay. Q. Is that fair? A. Yes. Fair. Q. Throughout the day, if you answer a question, I'm going to assume that you understood it. So if you don't -- if you do not understand a question, it's important I know that. Okay? A. Fair. Q. Throughout today I'm confident at points during your deposition, lawyers are going to make objections for the record. They're just doing their job. We're doing our lawyer things. Unless your lawyer instructs you not to answer and you follow that instruction, you still need to answer the question. Do you understand that? A. Yes. Q. Throughout today, we're not going to try to keep you here all day, but if you need a break, let us know, if you need to go to the bathroom, stretch your legs, whatever. And I do ask if we have a question pending or a line of questions or we're talking about a specific document, we finish that line of questions before we move on; is that fair? A. Fair. Q. Can you please give me your full name? A. Taylor Jesse Thompson. Q. Can you spell your middle name for me? A. J-e-s-s-e. Q. What is your home address? A. in Mesa, Arizona 85212. Q. Do you have a work address? A. Yes. Q. Is it different than your home address? A. Yes. Q. What is your work address? A. 1094 South Gilbert Road, Suite 201, Gilbert, Arizona 85296. Q. Do any of the other deponents, people being deposed, work at that address as well? A. Yes. Q. Who? A. Klaine Doucette. I'm trying to think specifically being deposed. Hector Barragan and -- as far as currently working there that are being deposed that I know of. Q. Is there anybody else that works there who's not being deposed? A. Yes. Q. Who? A. Dillon Kazemi, my brother Andy Thompson, Montell Hawkins. I'm trying to think of any -- Caden --Caden Towt is, I think, being deposed, and he is in and out of that office. And Larry Celaya used to be a part of that office, but is not. He moved out when the lease came due. Q. How many siblings do you have? A. I have two older brothers. Q. One of whom is Andy; right? A. Yeah. Q. What is your other older brother? A. Chad Thompson. Q. What's your date of birth? A. November 23, 1993. Q. And how much holder than you is Andy? A. Seven years. Q. Do you understand that you are under oath today and you've sworn to tell the truth? A. Yes. Q. Do you understand that the testimony you're going to give today is subject to the laws of perjury? A. Yes. Q. What does that mean to you, perjury? MR. ALONSO: I'm going to object to the question to the extent it seeks a legal conclusion. I don't think it's an appropriate question for this witness. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Do you have an understanding of what perjury means? A. Yes. Q. What is your understanding? A. That if I lie, I can go to jail for that if I'm under oath, in a general sense. Q. Have you ever been arrested? A. No. Q. Have you ever been convicted of a felony or any crime? A. No. Q. Have you ever filed for bankruptcy? A. No. Q. Do you have any plans to? A. No. Q. Is there any reason you're aware of that you could not testify fully and accurately today? A. No. Q. Have you drank any alcohol in the last 12 hours? A. No. Q. Are you taking any medication that could impede your ability to recall facts? A. No. Q. Just to be safe, to your knowledge, do you have any medical issues that could affect your memory? A. No. Q. Have you ever been a party to a lawsuit? A. No. Q. Have you ever been a party to any other kind of legal proceeding? A. No. Q. Did you go to the TerraWealth conference in North Carolina last year? A. No. There was no conference that I know of. Q. You didn't go to Charlotte? A. Charlotte. Yes. Wow, we're in 2023. That was last year. Q. Just barely. A. Yes. Q. Just barely. And when was that event in Charlotte? A. October 20th, something like that. Give or take a few days. I don't remember exactly. Q. At TerraWealth who is in your hierarchy? A. Define "hierarchy." What do you mean by -Q. Do you have a hierarchy at TerraWealth? A. Meaning, me personally have downlines that I override? Q. Oh. Are you -- we can start with that. Yes, do you have downlines that you override? A. I have, yes, a couple. Q. Who is that? A. Montell Hawkins and Kate Stuart and a gentleman named Mike McDonald who was never affiliated with Primerica. Q. But Montell Hawkins and Kate Stuart were affiliated with Primerica? A. They were life licensed with Primerica. Q. And you worked with them at Primerica? A. Correct. Q. Is there anybody else in your downline? A. No. Q. Who is in your upline at TerraWealth? A. I report directly to Tim Thompson, my father, and Janelle. Q. Tim and Janelle Thompson? A. Yeah. Q. And those are your parents? A. Correct. Q. Who from your upline and your downline attended the Charlotte conference? A. No one in my downline and Tim and Janelle attended the conference who are in my upline. Q. Who else was at that conference? A. I would say the majority of the vice presidents at TerraWealth. I mean, I know Klaine Doucette was there; Larry Celaya was there; Korey Doucette; Andy and Samantha Thompson, my brother and sister-in-law; Tim and Janelle. Gentlemen out of York, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. I don't remember their names. Aaron Fisher and... And then the TerraWealth leadership team, which would be Scott Leonard, Josh Mauk, Roy Matlock, like, Duane Morrow, David May, Mike Snider. Q. Do you remember anybody else who was affiliated with TerraWealth who attended? A. And spouses. So their significant others of those. Some, maybe not all. Jeremiah Diamond. That is what comes to my mind that are names specifically. I can picture faces but not names. Q. Do you know whether Jeremiah Diamond is a party to this lawsuit in Georgia? A. I do not know. Q. I'm going to show you what is marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1. (Exhibit 1 was marked for identification.) BY MR. TURMAN: Q. I will see if this refreshes your recollection. A. Sure. Q. After reviewing this document -- or what does this document appear to be? A. Picture of everybody at TerraWealth. That was at Charlotte. Specifically at Charlotte. Q. And who posted that picture? A. Looks like Roy Matlock. Q. On what social media app? A. Facebook. Q. Do you see anybody else here? Let me start back over. Does this picture refresh your recollection as to whether anyone else affiliated with TerraWealth attended that conference? A. As far as specific names? Q. Yes, please. A. That I can recall? Q. Uh-huh. A. I'm trying to think of specific TerraWealth members. That looks like -- I think it's Justin Pierce. I think that's Doug Wilkerson is his name. Andy Fray. I think -- I don't know all these people's names. I know 'em and I talk to 'em and shook their hand. Brie. Q. Who? A. Brie, who I think is Roy's -- she spoke. She was Roy's secretary. And then there's people that I do know the names, but they're not affiliated with TerraWealth. They're, like, Walker Ham, for existence (sic), is a representative of FIG. He is like a wholesaler, if you will. I don't know if you want those as well. Q. Yeah. Anyone else you see there you recognize. I would appreciate that. A. Victor Wilkerson, I think he's -- he works for Bison Advisors. Blake Schaper works at Bison Advisors. Christy and Lane Turner work at Bison Advisors. I know that guy in the back. I can see his face, but I don't remember his name. He's the CEO of Bison Advisors, but I don't remember his name. Q. Anybody else? A. Anne Doucette. She's right up front. That's Klaine's wife. If she would have been a snake, she would have bit me. And then Kristin Sanderson, and I know her husband would have been there. I don't remember his name. Q. What's Kristin's role? A. I don't know fully. She does a lot of technology stuff, it seems like. I don't know exactly what she does. That is -- there the Albrights. I think one is Eric Albright and there's an other one. An Albright. I don't remember exactly their names. Q. Are they brothers? A. I believe so. That's -- I don't think I got anybody else. Q. Did I hear the name Vic Wilkerson earlier? A. Yes. Q. Is that person related to the other person you said Wilkerson earlier? A. I -- I don't believe so, but I don't know. Q. And that was Doug; is that right? A. Doug Wilkerson and Victor Wilterson (sic). Q. Wilterson? A. Maybe. Q. Okay. So you don't have any reason to think they're related? A. I don't think so. Yeah, that's -- that's what I got. Q. When is the first time that you communicated with your attorney, Mr. Alonso? A. I feel like off the top of my memory, it would have been around Labor Day. The few days before, a few days after, to the best of my recall. Q. And we talked with some other people about some Zooms that took place. My understanding is there were some Zooms where all the people being deposed had a conversation with Mr. Alonso in late 2022. Were you on those? A. In late 2022, yes. I would have been on them. Q. About how many of those Zooms were they -- were there? A. I remember one for sure. There might have been two. Maybe more. Q. Tell me about that one that you remember for sure. When was that approximately? A. I don't remember the date and time or even month. It all runs together. Especially with the holidays. Probably half -- late November/December time frame. Q. And thank you very much for not guessing on dates. If you don't know, I don't want you to know (sic). So just having a general time, I appreciate that. So late November, early December, is that the first one of these kind of Zooms that you remember? A. Yes. Q. Who was on that Zoom? A. Tim Thompson, Janelle Thompson, myself, Klaine Doucette, Korey Doucette, Hector Barragan. Q. Was Larry? A. I believe Larry was. Q. How about Karen Dins? A. Yes, I believe she was. Q. How about Adam Dombrowski? A. I know it's not everyone made every meeting and it was hunting season. Q. Yeah. A. So, you know, in Wisconsin that's important. But, yeah, I think -- I believe those names were on. Q. How about Paul DeBuhr? A. I believe so. I -- it's hard to recall a specific one meeting with who was on and not on. Q. Was this meeting -- the first meeting you recall, was it more of a conversation or a presentation with one person speaking most of the time? MR. ALONSO: Object to the question. Could you please repeat that? (Requested portion of the record was read.) MR. ALONSO: Withdraw my objection. THE WITNESS: That first one, if I remember correctly, I vividly do recall at a meeting, I think it was first one, was Joseph was going through -MR. ALONSO: And I'm just going to interject. So, to the extent that he's asked you a question, I don't want you to divulge attorney/client privileged communications. THE WITNESS: Okay. MR. ALONSO: So, to the extent that it's a communication between yourself and me, your attorney, I don't want you to provide that information. So he's -- he's crafting careful questions to ask about the facts and circumstances underlying the communications. He's not seeking the substance of the communications. THE WITNESS: Then it was a little bit more of a presentation. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. I'm not asking what you asked, but did you ask any questions during this presentation? A. I did not ask any questions that I remember. Q. How long was this Zoom meeting about? A. Yeah. 45ish to an hour. Q. Were you watching this Zoom by yourself or physically with others? A. No. By myself. Q. Do you remember where you were when you were watching this Zoom? A. At my house in my home office. Q. Do you remember about what time of day this Zoom was? A. Probably 4, 5ish, give -- I mean, I think it was usually towards the end of the day. Q. What did you do after the Zoom ended? A. Probably ate dinner. Q. At any point after the Zoom, did you talk to your dad about it? A. At some point after the meeting. Not necess- -not necessarily that night or that date. Q. Right. Anytime after the Zoom ended. What did you talk about? MR. ALONSO: I'm going to object to the question to the extent that it seeks attorney/client privileged communications. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Have you signed any agreements with your dad relating to this litigation? A. No. Not that I understand. Q. To your knowledge, there's not a -- any kind of joint defense agreement that exists that you signed; correct? MR. ALONSO: Object to the question. Seeks a legal conclusion. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Have you signed --Okay. You haven't signed any agreements with him, so it doesn't matter. So, what did you and your dad talk about after that Zoom? A. Not anything that I remember about -- of the call. I don't have any recollection of that. Probably something to do with the Green Bay Packers and Wisconsin Badgers. Q. So you never talked to your dad about the substance of that Zoom meeting? A. I have no memory of one word he said or one word that I said. Q. And that wasn't really the question. The question was, did you ever talk to your dad about the substance of that Zoom conversation? A. I -- I don't think that specific meeting, no. Q. Or the substance of it? This lawsuit? A. We have spoke at some point about the lawsuit. Q. What did you talk about? A. Just what he thinks, I guess. Q. What does he think about the lawsuit? A. That it's silly. Q. Why does he think it's silly? A. It's a waste of time. Q. For who? A. Everyone involved. Q. You'd agree with me that you wanted your clients from Primerica to come with you to TerraWealth; right? A. I hoped that they would. Q. Because that would make more money for you; right? A. Make me some money. Q. It would make money for TerraWealth, too? A. Correct. Q. And Primerica would make less money from those clients? A. Yes. Q. Do you ever talk to your dad about these depositions? A. No. Q. Not even before they took place? A. Before we -- before they took place we chatted. Q. What did you chat about? A. Just when his was and when mine was and make sure I talked to Joseph, if I had any questions. Q. That's all you talked about with your dad? A. Yes. Q. So y'all don't really have a close relationship, then? MR. ALONSO: Object to the question. THE WITNESS: I have a close relationship with my dad, but per our legal counsel that we followed what we were supposed to do and not talk about anything that we weren't supposed to talk about. MR. ALONSO: And I would object to the question to the extent that it seeks attorney/client privileged communications. Please, when you're answering his questions, do not disclose the contents of our communications, including any legal advice I've given you. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Have you talked to your brother about these depositions? Either brother? A. I -- I have -- Andy knows about them. But, no, no specific details. Q. Have you talked to Andy about the lawsuit? A. He knows about them, but no specific details. Q. Have you talked to your brother about the lawsuit? A. No. Q. Do you think this lawsuit is silly? A. Yes. Q. Why? A. It's a waste of everybody's time. Q. What do you base that opinion on? A. The fact that what they're seeking are, you know, documents, and if I -- what we did and stuff and didn't do. That it's -- there's nothing there. Q. Nothing there regarding what? A. From what I was understanding of requesting documents and things and communications that that never happened or didn't happen or I was never solicited or recruited of any form and I never recruited or solicited anybody. Q. And that's your opinion? A. Well, that's -- yes, it's my opinion. Q. What is your understanding of -- do you have an understanding as far as what Primerica is suing the defendants for? A. Not in great detail. Q. So you don't really have a basis to know whether this lawsuit is silly? A. From what I have heard or what I'm -- what I think I know, I would say I base it off of being silly. Q. But you don't even know what the allegations are? A. Sure. Q. So you're making assumptions? A. In my opinion. Q. You're making assumptions in your opinion? A. Yes. Q. Let's talk about the second Zoom. We know there is more than one Zoom that took place, right, with the deponents and Mr. Alonso? A. I -- I believe that there was. Q. In all of the Zooms, who else spoke during the Zoom at any point in time? A. It would have been my dad, Tim Thompson; Klaine Doucette; and like Larry Celaya; Korey Doucette; Janelle that I can recall. Q. To your knowledge, is Janelle represented by Mr. Alonso? A. I do not know. MR. TURMAN: Mr. Alonso, do you want to go off the record and talk about that or you -- are you going to let me keep asking questions? MR. ALONSO: I don't see there's anything I need to discuss. I think he has answered your question. MR. TURMAN: Okay. Great. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Tell me about the substance of all the conversations on the first Zoom. MR. ALONSO: I'm sorry. You asked him if -- if his -- if Janelle was represented by me. MR. TURMAN: Uh-huh. Do you want to talk about that off the record? MR. ALONSO: I think you can ask additional questions. Obviously, I'm going to object to him disclosing anything that was discussed during those Zooms, but it's irrelevant as to whether or not he has personal knowledge of the -- of the -- of the legal determination as to whether or not I represent her. MR. TURMAN: Do you? MR. ALONSO: Yes. MR. TURMAN: Do you have an engagement letter? MR. ALONSO: If you have additional questions for this witness, please continue. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Do you have an engagement letter with Mr. Alonso? A. I -- I believe so, yes. Q. So you said Tim spoke, also Klaine, Larry, Korey, Janelle. Who else? A. Possibly others, but I don't recall. Q. Over all these Zooms, you don't recall anyone else verbally saying anything? A. I don't. Maybe Jack Knetter. And maybe Karen Dins. Q. But you don't remember for sure? A. I --Correct. Yeah, I don't remember for sure. Q. So before September 16th, you were at Primerica; right? A. Yes. Q. Your brother Andy was? A. Yes. Q. Your dad was? A. Yes. Q. Is it fair to say that you pushed your dad out the door? A. No. Q. Someone said that you pushed him out the door, would be not telling the truth? MR. ALONSO: Object to the request. Asking him to speculate on something that somebody else said, which has not been presented to him in full. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. I'll tell you your dad said you pushed him out the door. MR. ALONSO: Object to the question to the extent that it attempts to summarize what some- -- what somebody else said without this witness having an opportunity to read that statement in full. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Do you have any reason to dispute that he said that? A. I -- I think that that's interesting wording, but we had conversations. Q. But you dispute that you pushed your dad out the door? A. Yes. Q. And you think that is false? A. Yes. Q. In fact, you followed him to TerraWealth, didn't you? A. No. Q. What did you base your decision to go to TerraWealth on? A. Wanting to leave Primerica. Q. You thought it would be better at TerraWealth? A. I thought leaving Primerica would give me better opportunity elsewhere. Q. How did -- why did you think that the opportunity at TerraWealth would be better than it was at Primerica? A. Because TerraWealth does not have a bad name. That Primerica has a very bad name in the community, specifically. Q. Anything else? A. Technology at TerraWealth is a lot better or is better; meaning, for myself, as an advisor, the tools and resources. Q. What do you mean by that? A. Financial planning tools and software, better technology for clients to be able to log in to their own compliant portals, apps for the clients. And, like I said, tools and resources for me as far as CRNs, financial planning, things of that nature are drastically better than at Primerica. Q. Before September 16th, 2022, why did you think the tools and resources at TerraWealth would be drastically better than at Primerica? A. Before September 16th of 2022, why did I think that? Q. Uh-huh. A. Because I had requested information from Josh Mauk to show me and why -- what tools and resources they have to keep track of clients and serve clients, so I could make that decision for myself. Q. So it's fair to say that based on what Josh Mauk told you, you believed that TerraWealth would have tools and resources that were drastically better than what Primerica had? A. I made the conclusion after seeing them, having conversations that the tools were better than what Primerica has. Q. And your conclusion was based on what Josh Mauk told you? A. Per our conversations and demonstrations and then also doing research outside of that as well. Q. So it's based on what Josh Mauk told you, demonstrations, and the research that you did after hearing about this technology? A. Yes. Q. What other reasons did you think that TerraWealth was going to be a better opportunity for you than Primerica? Again, this question is targeted at what you thought before you decided to leave. A. I think a lot of those are the -- the main ones. I mean, nothing else necessarily comes -- the big one was the name. Marketing. That's a good one. Q. Okay. A. Marketing. Q. Tell me about that. A. Being able to actually market and brand the way that I want to be able to market and brand. And not have attorneys at Primerica reject everything that I want to do. Q. Why did you think you would be able to brand the way you want to brand at TerraWealth? A. Because their guidelines are not as strict as Primerica's guidelines. Q. How did you know that their guidelines are not as strict as Primerica's guidelines? A. Because they said that as long as it's allowed by FINRA and SEC, that those would be their guidelines. Q. Who said that? A. Josh Mauk per our conversations, per our conversations. Q. Does -A. When I asked him those type of questions -- I asked him those questions. Q. Did Josh Mauk ever talk about whether attorneys would shut down your branding efforts at TerraWealth? A. No. Q. But you had the impression that attorneys would not be telling you how to brand? A. Yeah. That was my conclusion. Q. Based on what Josh Mauk told you? A. Based on our conversations, yes. Q. Who was a part of these conversations? A. We had one, maybe two, Zooms a month with Josh as our so-called office from the, like, Klaine Doucette, because I know you're going to ask, Korey Doucette, Tim Thompson, Janelle Thompson, myself, Larry Celaya, and Andy and Samantha. Q. When did these Zoom calls start? What month? A. The month of May. I specifically remember May. Q. And then you had about one to two Zoom meetings per month up until resignation? A. Yeah. Not -- through the month of August not -definitely not in September I don't think, but, yeah, give -- give or take, to the best -- to the best I remember. Q. Okay. So you thought -- before you made the decision to leave Primerica, you thought that TerraWealth would have better technology. You thought TerraWealth would have better marketing. Did you think that anything else about TerraWealth was going to be better for you? A. I mean, no. I was pretty jacked up and excited about those. That was good enough for me. Q. Did you think that moving your clients over to TerraWealth was going to be better for your clients? A. Yeah. Hence, better client technology. Q. Any other reasons, other than technology? A. Yeah, a much wider range of products and services, being completely independent rather than captive. That's, you know, better for a client. Q. How is you being independent better for your clients? A. I don't have to sell -- I'm not strict -restricted to seven mutual fund families or, you know, only 10 or 11 different investment managers on the managed account platform at Primerica. I have the universe. Q. And if you can kind of elaborate a little more, what did you mean by there would be a wider range of products and services at TerraWealth? A. What -- what would a wider range be? We have, for example, the universe of the investment products for managed accounts, ETFs, mutual funds, versus if I wanted to sell a mutual fund at Primerica, I had five or six mutual fund families to choose from and that was it. And then if I did managed money or annuities, there was only three or four families of investment products that I could offer in each sub -- like category. And I couldn't do indexes. And I want to be able to market indexes for clients, to where it's appropriate. Q. Any other products or services? A. Insurance in the sense of being able to offer different products of life insurance, like IULs, whole life, those types of products. Q. How did you know that you would be able to offer these types of products and services at TerraWealth? A. Per our conversations leading up to that time with Zooms, asking those kind of questions and doing research. Q. And you learned this information from Josh Mauk? A. Yes. Answering our questions upon -- as we thought of them during that time. Q. And all these communications were not in writing; correct? A. Yeah, correct. Q. Is there a reason for that? A. No specific reason. Just if I wanted to see what a life insurance quote would look like, you can't really put that in writing. You gotta hop on a Zoom and show me for an example. Q. What all kinds of things -- or on these Zooms, would Mr. Mauk share his screen frequently? A. He would share -- I don't know if he was sharing his whole screen or just that display, but, yes. Q. What kind of things did he show you during this Zoom meetings? A. CRMs, tools like that. Q. He'd demonstrate how they work? A. Yeah. Or those types of things that... Q. Did you use SalesTeamPro when you were at Primerica? A. I had started to, yes. Q. About how long did you use it? A. Fortunately, it was bad timing for me. I remember right around Thanksgiving of November, obviously, that's when Thanksgiving falls, the -- the '20, '21 I think is the year it would have been then, I had just got onboarded or started. Q. And how long had you had been at Primerica? A. Before September 16th? Q. Perfect. Let me ask, before September 16th? A. I was life licensed since 2012. Life insurance licensed when I turned 18, but I didn't get on SalesTeamPro until obviously -- that was when I first started it. Q. And you will agree with me that when you started with Primerica, you signed a Basic Agreement with them? A. Yes. Q. And you agree with me that it was common knowledge among people working at Primerica that everyone signs a document like that when they start out with Primerica? A. Yes. Q. So you don't have any reason to dispute that Roy Matlock knew you signed an agreement with Primerica? A. Can you ask that again? Q. Yes. You don't have any reason to dispute that Roy Matlock knew at some point in time you signed an agreement with Primerica? A. Yes. Q. Same question for Scott Leonard? A. Yes. MR. SPALTEN: Objection. Foundation. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Same question for Duane Morrow? A. Yes. MR. SPALTEN: Same objection. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Same question for Josh Mauk? A. Yes. MR. SPALTEN: Same objection. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Same question for -MR. SPALTEN: Mr. Witness, I'm trying to state objections. If you could just wait before you answer so any counsel needing to object can state the objection for the record, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. And I'm sensing an objection, so you'll want to wait a second here. Same question for Jeremiah Diamond? MR. SPALTEN: Same objection. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. You can answer. A. Yes. Q. When did you first learn about the existence of TerraWealth? A. Marchish. Q. Of 2022? A. Yes. Q. How did you first learn about the existence of TerraWealth? A. In a phone call from my dad. Q. During that phone call what did you learn about TerraWealth? A. Not a lot, other than there was rumblings that a new company was being started by Roy Matlock, specifically. Q. Had you ever spoken to Roy Matlock prior to that time? A. No. Q. But you knew who he was? A. Because I was onboarded on SalesTeamPro in November, so three or four months before, whatever that time frame would have been, I had known of him, but I didn't -- I -- I knew the name, but I never met him or heard of him or anything really before I had gotten on SalesTeamPro. But then since I was on SalesTeamPro, I had seen him in a couple of trainings, if you will. Q. Do you know when your dad, Tim Thompson, decided that he wanted to leave Primerica and go to TerraWealth? A. I don't know that definite when he decided. I know for sure it was September 16th. Q. So in March 2022, you first learned about TerraWealth via a phone call with your dad. When is the next time that you learned anything about TerraWealth? A. No additional real information until May and we started to get on with Josh. That phone call specifically with my dad was a Zoom call with my brother, my sister, and my mom and dad and myself, to -- this is what they had heard, that there was -- and that's why there was no additional information really until May because there was really no company. There was just rumblings, so... There was no additional information, other than he's hearing that there's another company being made or created or started or... Q. Did your dad tell you how he knew that another company was being made? A. He had just gotten back from Hawaii, the Primerica company trip, and there was a lot of rumblings within a lot of the senior leaders and million dollar earners. And that's what I recall him saying, that he had just heard through the grapevine that this is -- people were talking about it. Gossip and hearsay, I'm sure. Q. And if you don't know, that's fine, but do you know who told him about that in Hawaii? A. No. I have no idea. Q. So on your first Zoom with Josh Mauk in May, do you remember who attended that Zoom meeting? A. Yes. Q. Who? A. That was myself, Andy and Samantha, Tim and Janelle, Klaine and Korey and Larry. The vice -- kind of the vice president, or -- and family, I guess you can say. Q. Do you know whose idea it was to have this Zoom meeting? A. I think it would have been my father's to go. We all have a lot of questions, so let's ask Josh. Q. So it's fair to say your dad organized the meeting? A. Yes. Q. When did you decide that you were going to leave Primerica and go to TerraWealth? A. Personally, I wanted to leave Primerica four years ago, and when -- as soon as Dad told me that there was rumblings of a company being started in March, I wanted to leave. I was ready to go. So, if anything, we stayed longer because of my dad and my mom and their relationships that they had with people at Primerica and connections with the higher-ups. I would -- I would say until late August, September, it was where I was like, yeah, I think that this is the right decision for me and my family. Q. So you decided -- you made that decision in either late August or early September? A. To specifically leave and go to TerraWealth. Q. Did you ever access Primerica Online after you made that decision? A. Access Primerica Online after I decided mentally that I wanted to leave? Q. Yes. A. Yes. Q. What did you access on Primerica Online during those times? A. Just basic client servicing information. Q. Like what? A. Like if a client wanted to take money out of their account, I helped them with that request. Q. Did clients want to take money out of their accounts during that time period? A. It seems like it's constant. I mean, yeah, that's my fiduciary responsibility to service my clients, and... Q. Did you look at any client contact information during that time period? A. On Primerica Online? Q. Yes. A. No. Q. So I want to make sure we're clear, tell me if I'm wrong. I believe your testimony is you only accessed Primerica Online in response to things that clients requested; is that fair? A. No. That was an example. Q. Okay. So why else did you access Primerica Online during that time period? A. Check Primerica e-mail. Q. What else? A. Check -- run FNAs, financial needs analysis, financial calculators, maybe term life quotes, look at compensation, making sure my checks are getting cut and at the right amounts. Q. You weren't trying to give life quotes during that time period, were you? A. No. I'm just saying that as -- that's within financial calculators and the calculator software within the FNA. No. My wife and I had a baby July 17th. Until September 16th, I -- I didn't even really work for two months at all. Q. But you accessed Primerica Online? A. Yes. Q. And you checked to see what your AUM was? A. Yeah. Yes. Q. What was the amount of assets under management before you left Primerica? A. That's a loaded question because Primerica Online -- I mean, it doesn't even know all of the data of clients' information. So there are some accounts that would pull up and some accounts that wouldn't pull up at that time. I don't know if it's obviously better, but, one report would say one thing and another report would say a different thing. Q. And I'll -A. According to client data now, which I think is going to be your question, that was a report, I was close or right around of $10 million of assets under management. MR. TURMAN: I will object as nonresponsive to a portion of that answer. I could have been more clear, though. That is on me. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. I'm going to show you what is marked as Exhibit No. 2. (Exhibit 2 was marked for identification.) BY MR. TURMAN: Q. This is the deposition notice and subpoena you received for today's deposition; correct? A. Yeah. Q. And it's a different date because we shifted them to the next month. So you've seen that document before? A. Where's the date? Q. I believe at the bottom. A. Wednesday, the 14th. Q. Yes. Obviously, today is not December 14th; right? A. Yeah. Q. So we shifted them to the following month per agreement. But you received that document; correct? A. This looks familiar. Q. I will show you what's marked as Exhibit No. 3, since we were just talking about assets under management. (Exhibit 3 was marked for identification.) MR. TURMAN: Here is your copy, Mr. Alonso. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. And I'll tell you we have the last names of the clients and the fund account numbers. I'll take -- I'll give you a minute to review this document, if you'd like. And I will have a couple questions for you. You ready? A. Uh-huh. Q. You'll agree with me that a good number of these clients are now your clients at TerraWealth; correct? A. Yes. Q. And, to your knowledge, they are no longer Primerica clients? A. Yes. Q. If you can flip to the final page, please. Because we were talking about the assets under management, do you see the column titled August 2022 AUM? A. Yes. Q. And at the very bottom of that, can you please read for the record what the total for your assets under management was as of August 2022? A. You want the whole exact number? Q. Sure. A. $10,454,470.51. MR. ALONSO: I just want to raise an objection to this exhibit to the extent that we have not been provided with the underlying data. MR. TURMAN: And I'll give you a running objection on that, if you want, for these next questions. It's up to you. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. And you'll see a couple columns over we have 12/8/22 value. You recognize that's December 8th; right? A. Yes. Q. Of 2022. And can you please read the amount of assets under management at the bottom of that column? A. $4,842,031.88. Q. And you'll agree with me that that -- the difference between the numbers in August 2022 and December 8th, 2022, is over $5.6 million? A. Yes. Q. And you'll agree that that's a decrease of over 53 percent? A. Yes. Q. And you would agree with me that TerraWealth financially benefited from those clients ceasing their business with Primerica and moving to TerraWealth? A. Yes. Q. And that also financially harmed Primerica? A. Yes. Q. While at TerraWealth, how often do you communicate with Mr. Mauk? A. Maybe once every two weeks, if I have a question. Q. What's your understanding of his role at TerraWealth? A. He's the president and CMO and he also is servicing his own clients. Q. In your -- do you have an opinion as far as who is in charge of TerraWealth? A. I mean, I don't think there is one person, so, no, I don't have an opinion. Q. Do you have an opinion as to who the people in charge of TerraWealth are? A. Based off of their public website, I would refer to that for the leadership team. Q. And so what's your understanding as to who is on the leadership team? A. Scott Leonard is the CEO. Josh is president and CMO. And then Roy is a chairman, I think. I don't know what his exact role is. And then I know Duane Morrow, Jeremiah Diamond, and David May and Mike Snider are involved. I don't know what their exact titles and roles are. Q. You would agree with me that the leadership team has the power to say we don't want certain people to join TerraWealth. I'll go back again. I want to make it more clear. You'll agree with me that the leadership team has the power to say that we don't want certain representatives to work at TerraWealth? MR. ALONSO: Object to the question. Asks him to speculate. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Do you agree with that statement? A. Ask it again. Q. You'll agree with me that the leadership team has the power to say they don't want certain representatives from other firms to come over and be representatives at TerraWealth? MR. ALONSO: Same objection. THE WITNESS: I think so. I think every firm should have that right. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. I'm going to show you what is marked as Exhibit 4. (Exhibit 4 was marked for identification.) BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Do you recognize that document? A. Yes. Q. What is it? A. A letter of resignation. Q. And you'll agree with me that Josh Mauk drafted this; right? A. No. Q. Why are you not agreeing with that? A. Because it was drafted by our attorney, Joseph, from my understanding. Q. So you don't know for sure who drafted it; correct? A. Correct. Q. You didn't draft it? A. No. Q. So these aren't your words? A. No. I signed it. Q. Did you make any revisions to the language of this letter? A. No. Q. Did you suggest or propose any of the language that was included in this letter? A. No. Q. What printed client information did you mail back to Primerica? A. Their contact information and notes or maybe statements that I might have had in their folders. Socials, copies of driver's license, maybe a copy of a voided check that I would have had to open an account for them. Those types of miscellaneous items that I had. It was a big box. Q. Was it one box? A. Yes. Q. How did you mail it back? A. Snail mail express something. Q. Okay. A. I'm a millennial. I don't do a lot of mailing. I had to make sure I was mailing something correctly. Q. You strike me as someone who is a lot more technologically savvy than the other people we've been talking to this week. A. I'm definitely more tech savvy than my father, but I'm not a tech guru, that's for sure. Q. Okay. THE COURT REPORTER: A tech? THE WITNESS: Guru. THE COURT REPORTER: Thank you. THE WITNESS: No, I'm... BY MR. TURMAN: Q. You also -- this letter says that you deleted any and all client data and information from all devices; is that accurate? A. Yes. Q. What devices did you delete data from? A. My phone and computer. Q. What kind of phone do you have? A. An iPhone. Q. Do you know what model? A. No. It's a --No. It'd be speculation, so I don't know. Q. And you currently have the same phone that you had back then; right? A. Yes. Q. What steps did you take to delete data and information from your phone? A. Can you be more specific with what you mean by steps? Q. Yeah. What -- what did you do? How did you delete it? A. Okay. I went in to messages and deleted messages. Contact information I deleted making sure that I didn't take any of that data with me. E-mails, because obviously e-mails have clients' information, so I deleted it to make sure I didn't bring it with me. And then on my computer, I obviously had, like any probably financial advisor has, data on their computer, so I made sure I deleted maybe spreadsheets or client reports of, you know, their retirement plan or whatever it may have been, statements. Anything and everything was deleted. Q. Which contacts did you delete from your phone? A. Every single one that was a client. Q. But you didn't delete contact info for other representatives, did you? A. I did, actually, yes. Q. All of them? A. Yes, even my mother, my father. I deleted my wife because she's a client. And then I resigned and said, Hey, babe, can I get your number again? And I had my fingers crossed hoping she'd give it to me. Q. You got it; right? A. I got it. I closed. Q. Congrats. The sentence in here says you are aware of existing litigation initiated by Primerica involving TerraWealth's principals. Was that a true statement at the time? A. Yeah, I was aware of that -- there is stuff going on between them. Specifics, I'm not privy to. Q. Did you think it was silly back then or did you form that opinion after you joined TerraWealth? A. My situation asking if I took client data is what I was referring to as silly and a waste of time. Q. So you're not saying the lawsuit is silly and a waste of time? A. It could be; could not be. I'm not privy to the details. Q. Next it says you did not expect there to be any issues regarding your resignation? A. That is correct. Q. Did you believe that at the time you sent this letter? A. Yeah. Q. Why? A. Why should I not be allowed to resign and go take employment at another firm? I help clients -- I don't help clients, but clients all the time leave their job and go to another job and I help them rollover their 401(k) and those previous firms don't sue them and come after them. Q. So you meant, you don't expect there to be any issues -A. With me resigning. Q. -- with them coming after you; right? A. Sure. Q. You are saying you didn't believe that you were doing anything wrong? A. I -- yes, I did not. Q. You're not giving an opinion on whether TerraWealth has done anything wrong? A. I don't -- yeah, I don't know their situation. Q. When did you first learn that you'd be able to use Fidelity at TerraWealth? A. Those would have been in those conversations and questions of us asking probably around that May time frame. It could have been in May. It could have been in June. We were asking, you know, what is going to be the clearing custodian for clients. Q. And that was important information to you, wasn't it? A. Yeah. Obviously, where's my clients going to log in and see their accounts. Q. You could also -- you knew that meant that you could also manage your clients' 401(k)s, too? A. In what capacity? Q. Could you not manage the assets in the 401(k) through Fidelity? A. Not if it's not at Fidelity. If a client has a 401(k) at John Hancock -Q. Uh-huh. A. -- I cannot manage that at Fidelity on Fidelity's platform. Q. Okay. But there are situations on Fidelity's platform where you could manage their 401(k) assets? A. If they have a 401(k) with Fidelity. I have not done that yet, and I don't know the process or protocol on how to do that, but there is situations that has arose that they've said that you can do that. Q. You knew that potential was there with -A. That potential was there, yeah. Q. And you knew that you didn't have that potential at Primerica? A. Correct. Q. That was exciting to you; right? A. Yes. That would again go back to the technology and tools and resources to be able to better and deeply serve our clients with our fiduciary responsibility. Q. And you didn't know that you would be able to use the Fidelity platform until Mr. Mauk told you? A. Yes. And there's other platforms you can use as well. It doesn't just have to be Fidelity, from my understanding. Q. How long have you been using Clubhouse? A. Like max two months. I never even heard of it. Q. How did you hear about it? A. After I moved over to TerraWealth, it was something they were going to use just for TerraWealth people for training purposes. THE VIDEOGRAPHER: I apologize to interrupt. Can I have you move your mike to the -- to your polo shirt. Sometimes metal zippers is not a fan. Thank you. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. And so someone at TerraWealth is the person who taught you -- or made you aware of Clubhouse? A. Yes. Q. Do you like it? A. No. I deleted it already off my phone. Q. Why? A. Because it was not anything that I really used or needed. It takes up data. Q. That's true. How often would you join the TerraWealth advisors Clubhouse meetings? A. I joined the first couple. I missed a few because I had military obligations. I was traveling over holidays. So I probably was on a total of four or five, and it's been discontinued now. They're not doing it anymore. Q. Do you know why? A. Yeah. It doesn't work for trying to record something for podcast purposes or something. I don't know. Q. So you think they stopped doing Clubhouse because there were issues with recording them? A. To do a podcast version of it or something like that. I don't know. Q. So you think they might want to do a podcast version instead? A. I think so. Something. Q. Okay. I'm just trying to understand the situation. A. Yeah, I don't know. All I know is they're not using Clubhouse anymore, so I happily deleted it. Q. And the TerraWealth advisors' room was a private room; right? A. Yes. Q. How did you get access to that room? A. I was invited. Q. Who invited you? A. Josh. Q. And you'd speak during those meetings, wouldn't you? A. Yeah, if I had something to say. Q. What did you talk about? A. Social media, branding, marketing ideas, how I'd run my 4D financial process for clients. Q. And you agree with me that at least on one occasion, someone on the call would say something negative about Primerica; right? A. No. Q. You don't think anyone ever said anything negative about Primerica? A. Not on the Clubhouse call, I don't have any recollection of any of that. Q. Even on Clubhouse calls that you attended? A. Yes. Q. So you're saying you don't remember it; you're not saying it didn't happen? A. Yes. I'm also -- I get phone calls during those and I can pop off, so I didn't hear every word that was said. Q. So it's possible someone said something negative about Clubhouse -- it's possible that someone said something negative about Primerica at a time when you were not listening to the Clubhouse meeting? A. Yes. MR. SPALTEN: Object. Calls for speculation. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. You'd agree that's possible? A. Yes, it's possible in a private TerraWealth Clubhouse meeting. MR. SPALTEN: Same objection. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. But not all of the TerraWealth Clubhouse meetings were private, were they? A. I don't know. I have no clue what makes a private or public meeting on Clubhouse. Q. What all forms of social media do you use? A. Facebook, LinkedIn. And then I use Instagram, and then I have a Twitter that has really nothing to do with anything other than following, tracking sports and local sports reporters that I like for news and updates. Q. What is your favorite team? A. Green Bay. Cut me open and I bleed green and gold. Q. Good luck next week. A. Yeah. We're going to need it. Q. What do you think about the haircut? A. Rogers? Q. Uh-huh. A. He needs to discount double-check his hairdo. That's what he needs to do. You make $50 million, you can cut your hair however you want. That's my rule of life. Q. I will show you Exhibit No. 5. (Exhibit 5 was marked for identification.) BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Take minute to review it. Tell me when you are ready, please. A. Ready. Q. Do you recognize that document? A. Uh-huh. Yes. Q. What is it? A. It's a financial advisor acknowledgment. Q. And you submitted that to Primerica on September 16, 2022; correct? A. Yes, in addition to my resignation. Q. And you don't know who crafted the language in this acknowledgment, do you? A. No, not specifically. Q. Where did you get this document from? A. From? Q. What -- step back. You signed this document; right? A. Yes. Q. You didn't draft it? A. No. Q. So somehow you got this document and then you signed it. How did you get that document? A. Via, I believe, e-mail from my mom who I believe, from my understanding, was she received it from Joseph, our attorney. Q. Do you still have that e-mail from your mom transmitting this document? A. No. Q. Why not? A. I -- I don't -- didn't keep anything like that. Or I don't know if it was an e-mail or if... It might have been through Google Drive and shared with me, maybe. I don't know specifically. Q. What steps would you take to find out if you still have a copy of that document or that transmission? A. I know I don't have it as an e-mail. I --Can you ask that question again? Q. How do you know you don't have it as an e-mail? A. Well, when you guys asked me to fish up all documents, I didn't have any e-mails. Q. Do you know -- did you delete a lot of e-mails prior to resigning? A. Yes. Q. So it's possible that you received this via e-mail and you deleted it? A. That's possible. Q. When is the first time you heard of Cape Securities, Inc.? A. Pretty close to when we were getting ready to resign. Q. How did you first learn of Cape Securities, Inc.'s existence? A. That would have been a Zoom call with Scott Leonard. Q. What did Scott Leonard tell you about Cape Securities, Inc.? A. That's just going to be a firm that is going to, like, hold our licenses, and we can do BD, broker/dealer, A share mutual funds and variable annuity products through them. Q. Who else was on that Zoom? A. At this point it would have been Klaine, Korey, Andy, Samantha, Tim, Janelle, myself, Larry Celaya, Jack Knetter, Adam Dombrowski, Dillon Kazemi, Hector Barragan. Gosh, it's crazy how you know all these people and then you try to remember 'em all. Karen Dins. For sure Karen. Pete Spychalla, Paul DeBuhr. Nate Knetter. No relation. Actually, I think they're fifth generation cousins. Bonnie Rogers. Patrick might have been on. I don't -- I don't even know Patrick. I've never met him. Q. Patrick Stickler? A. I think so, yeah. A few others. People that are, you know, just life-licensed, just learning the process or whatever, but I don't -- any specific names. Q. You said you know for sure that Karen Dins was on. Is that because you remember something she said? A. No. She's just a -- she's just a RVP. So that's like Klaine, Korey, RVP. She's a bigger named person than some of these other people. Q. Got it. What else did this group and Mr. Leonard talk about during that Zoom? A. Licensing process. Maybe how to study, add a new license, how to transfer a license, how to do a U4 to a U5, whatever that steps were in process. Q. So is it fair to say he was walking you through the transition process from Primerica to TerraWealth? A. That through -- initially, he just introduced us to Cape, and then Cape Securities' team, who I don't know any names specifically, but they -- you know, if you're going to leave a firm, this is the steps and how you do it. Q. When is the first time you heard about Merchant? A. Maybe April or May, give or take. Q. Of 2022? A. Yes, sir. Q. How did you first learn about Merchant? A. My dad said that this is a private equity firm that's backing TerraWealth. Q. Did your dad say anything else about Merchant? A. No, just research -- look -- look 'em up, so I looked them up. I don't know how to research and look up a private equity firm. It's a little bit over my skis. Q. So after that first conversation and after you looking them up, did you learn anything else about Merchant? A. Huh-uh. There was something where it was sent to us -- or, like, go listen to this podcast on their website or something. So I did that and I listened to it, but it wasn't anything that I was like -- it was just the guy talking about investing in -- I don't even know who it was, just someone at Merchant who talked about their firm's investment philosophies and partnerships and investing in financial firms and things. But, again, it wasn't any -- I mean, that's not my background as far as finance and business side of things, so it wasn't anything to me that was a big ordeal. Q. On that podcast do you remember if they talked about investing in YouTube stars? A. No. Q. Just curious. A. No. I don't. Q. You know who MrBeast is? A. I do. Q. Okay. A. Was they the ones that wanted to buy him? Q. They were -MR. ALONSO: Object. THE WITNESS: Sorry. MR. TURMAN: See this -- this happens in a deposition. We can talk later with your attorney present. But it was some interesting stuff regarding MrBeast. (Next page, please.) BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Since April and May of 2022, have you learned anything else about Merchant? A. No. Q. When is the first time that you heard about Apollon? A. Man, I don't know a specific time, but it would have been at some point in that window of, let's say, May to September, but I don't -- to be honest, I still don't really fully know what Apollon does. So... Q. Do you know if there is any relationship between Apollon and TerraWealth? A. I don't know, other than I know that they have created investment options for us or a part of that. That's really all I know that they're helping with. Q. Did you learn about those creative investment options before you resigned from Primerica? A. No, I don't think so. Q. And I'm not asking you to speculate here, but do you know if there's any relationship between Apollon and Merchant? A. No, I don't know. Q. I will show you what is marked as Exhibit No. 6. (Exhibit 6 was marked for identification.) (Next page, please.) BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Mr. Thompson, have you seen that document before? And feel free to review it. A. Yes, I believe I have. Q. Do you know when the first time is that you saw that document? A. No. I believe it was a part of this one, when I got this. Q. And "this," you're referring to the subpoena? A. Yes. Q. Okay. A. That's the term of what we call that. I believe that was a part of my packet. Q. When you got the letter, did you read it? A. Which letter? Q. Exhibit No. 6. A. No, I did not read that. Q. But you did receive a copy of it? A. I do believe. Q. Did you read or review the orders enclosed with this letter? So if you go to, I think, page 4 maybe is the first one, and then there's three different orders. A. What page? Q. So the letter is first in the packet and then after that in Exhibit 6, there are other orders from the Court in Georgia. And you don't need to review them all now -A. No. Q. -- unless you want to. I was just asking you if you have ever reviewed them before. A. No. Q. When is the first time that you became aware that the Court in Georgia entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants? A. I didn't necessarily know that. Q. So is it fair to say that now? A. Sure. Yes. Q. Okay. And just to short- -- just to short-cut this, is now the first time you're aware that the Court entered a consent restraining order? A. Yes. Q. And the same question for the supplemental consent restraining order? A. Yes. Q. Have you ever reviewed any of the pleadings from the Georgia case? A. No. Q. And I think I know the answer to this, but I just want to confirm. Is it fair to say that no one from TerraWealth ever told you, ever informed you of the existence of any of these orders in the Georgia case? A. Ask it again. Q. Is it true that nobody from TerraWealth ever informed you of the existence of any of those orders in the Georgia case? A. Yes. Q. Thank you for bearing with me. There were a lot of words there. A. Yeah. MR. TURMAN: Mr. Alonso, we definitely have more, but now is probably a good time to take a break if y'all want. MR. ALONSO: Sure. THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going to be going off the record. The time is now 10:24. (A recess was taken from 10:24 a.m. until 10:34 a.m.) THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record. The time is now 10:34. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Mr. Thompson, welcome back. A. Good to be back. Q. So I don't want you to speculate here, but do you know about how many connections you have on Facebook? A. It's over a thousand. Under 2,000, I think. Q. And is it fair to say that as of September 20, 2022, some of those connections were clients when you were at Primerica? A. Yeah. Q. And some of those connections were representatives from Primerica? A. Some. Q. And some of them came with you to TerraWealth; right? A. Yes. Q. And some of the other connections were still at Primerica? A. Yes. Q. And you understand that when you post something on Facebook, all your connections can see it; right? A. Yes. Q. I'm going to show you what is marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 7. (Exhibit 7 was marked for identification.) BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Do you recognize that? A. Which part? All of it? Q. The post. A. Yes. Q. What is it? A. It's a post of a new job description or starting a new career. New place of employment would be a better way to say it. Q. And it says, started new job at TerraWealth; is that correct? A. Yes. Q. And can you read what it says under that? A. September-TerraWealth, Gilbert, Arizona. Very excited about this transition to a wonderful new company. We have so many new tools to better and more deeply serve our clients. Time to go to work. Q. And those are your words; correct? A. Yes. Q. You were excited; is that fair? A. Yes. Q. And you were telling all of your connections that now that you're at TerraWealth, you would be able to better and more deeply serve your clients? A. Yes. In my opinion. Q. What was that opinion based on? A. Our meetings, that we had already discussed, May, June, showing us different tools and CRNs and financial planning softwares and better -- more robust products and services or more options for clients. Q. And Josh Mauk was the one who showed you those things; right? A. Yes. Q. The first comment, Liz Denisen says: We are so excited for you all. And you responded, Thank you. Been a long time coming. What did you mean when you said "been a long time coming"? A. As I stated earlier, when you asked, I wanted to leave Primerica almost four years ago. So I was excited about a new venture. Q. On the next page, if you want to flip it over, Andy said, Excited for this journey we are on. It's great to be in business with you all. And then a thumbs up emoji. And you responded, Ann Doucette, it's been a long, fun journey. And then what is that emoji that you put after "journey"? A. I think it's supposed to be a smiley face but it looks blurred or fuzzy with the "like" on it. Q. Do you think it's a different than a traditional smiley face? A. No, I think it's a smiley face. Q. You don't think it's winking or smirking? A. No, I don't think so. I think -- I don't know. I feel like it would be speculation, so... Q. You typed it? A. Yeah. Q. I'm not going to grill you over the emoji. I was just curious. A. I use a lot of smiley faces when I type. Probably an excessive amount of smiley faces. Q. Does anyone ever get onto you for using emojis? A. No. Q. Let me show you what is marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 8. (Exhibit 8 was marked for identification.) BY MR. TURMAN: Q. I will represent to you these are documents from your production, and we will talk about some specific pages within there. A. Okay. Q. Starting off on that front page, page -- at the bottom it says Taylor Thompson 000006. Is that your handwriting? A. No. Q. Whose is it? A. My wife, Danielle Thompson. Q. Does she work for TerraWealth? A. No. Q. Does she normally take these kind of notes for you? A. Yes. Q. So on page 1, I will just say P and L , last name starts with S? A.S . Q. Where did your wife, Danielle, get this information that she wrote on the page? A. From me directly. Q. When did she get that information from you? A. I don't remember exactly. But would have been after that date. Not 9/22/22, so probably later that day, maybe the next morning. Q. How did you give her this information? A. Verbally. Q. In person? A. Yes, in our house. Q. Why did you have her write it down instead of you? A. Because her penmanship is immaculate. Q. That's true. That's why I was going to be very impressed if it was your handwriting. A. I have chicken-scratch handwriting. So... Q. I think we will see that a little bit later in this production. If you will flip with me to the page that's numbered Taylor Thompson, a bunch of zeros, and then it says 11. We were looking at S and what's the other person's name? A.T . Q. So there's a star a little bit down the page that says, received contact info from, and then there's a blank. Do you know why there's a blank? A. Huh-uh. Nope. Probably just forgot to -- to write down where we got it from. Q. Where did you get it from? A. Him, specifically, was from Facebook. I've known S since kindergarten. MR. TURMAN: Object as nonresponsive to the last sentence. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. How did you get this information from Facebook? A. I messaged S . Q. What was the point of writing all these things down? A. To show when and where after the fact of resignation that I didn't take any client data with me, any information, that everything was deleted. Q. Was that your idea to do this? A. No. It was per our conversation with our attorney. Q. I'm not going to go further on that. So you know that you got S 's contact information from Facebook; right? A. I do know that, yes. Q. Did you initiate that contact with him? A. I did. Q. Because you wanted to get his contact information; right? A. Yes. Q. And you wanted him to do business with you at TerraWealth? A. First, I wanted to share with him about my resignation, because I have the fiduciary responsibility to let him know that if he stays there, I can't serve him. And also, like I stated, he's a friend, so whether he does business with me or not, I want his -- I want to be able to send him a Christmas card. Q. You still wanted him to follow you; right? A. Yes. Q. I want you to listen carefully to my question so we don't go too far. Did anybody give you guidance or advice as to what you should say or not say when reaching out to your clients after resigning? MR. ALONSO: I'm going to object to the question to the extent it might seek attorney/client privileged communications. I would ask you to answer the question in full without reference to any attorney/client privileged communications. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. I'd ask the same thing. A. Ask the question again. Q. Did anybody give you guidance as to what you should or should not say to clients after you submit your resignation to Primerica? A. Yes. Q. Don't tell me what they said, but who? A. My attorney. Q. Who else? A. That was it. Q. Did you and your dad ever talk about that topic? A. Not without our attorney. Q. Did you and your dad ever talk to each other about it regardless who was around? A. Not that I recall. Q. Did you ever talk to Andy about that topic? A. Not that I recall. Q. Or Sammie? A. No. Q. Janelle? A. No. Q. Did you ever talk to any of your family members? Actually, I'm going to go back. I'm not asking for communications with your wife for this question. Did you ever talk to any of your family members about whether clients that you had at Primerica were going to come over to TerraWealth? A. Yes. Q. Who did you talk to about that topic? A. All of them probably in a group setting, maybe a Zoom call. Q. Pretty soon after the resignation? A. Maybe, yeah. I don't know a time frame. Q. Did y'all kind of compare notes to see who is getting their clients to follow? A. Not necessarily to follow, but what is your response maybe, I would say. Q. What do you mean by that? What is your response? A. Like what do clients say. That kind of thing. Not necessarily, like, oh, yeah, this one came with me, that one came with me. It wasn't necessarily that. It was more of whatever may be clients' feedbacks. Q. Through these conversations did you learn about what some of the other departing representatives told their clients about TerraWealth? A. Not anything new, no. Q. What did you tell your clients about TerraWealth? A. That that was the new firm that I was going to. Q. What else did you tell them? A. That I resigned from Primerica. Q. Well, if we look at that last exhibit, too, you told them you would be able to more deeply serve them and better serve them; right? MR. ALONSO: Object to the question. References a very specific document. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. You can answer. A. On this one? Q. Uh-huh. A. On -- that I said that I can -- we have so many new tools to better and more deeply serve our clients. Yes, I said that on Facebook. Q. And when you say "we," you were referring to yourself and TerraWealth; correct? A. Yes, just as a --Yeah. Q. And your clients who were connected to you on Facebook could have easily seen this communication? A. Yes. Q. You actually wanted them to see it, didn't you? A. I --No, not necessarily. Q. You didn't care if anyone saw your Facebook post? A. I mean, it maybe helped; maybe it didn't help. I don't know. Q. Why did you do it? Why did you post that? A. Well, I was just updating my thing on Facebook, so... I would say I have very few clients that I'm actually friends with on Facebook of my thousand or almost 2,000 people I'm friends. So more so, prospects, maybe potential new people I haven't talked to can see it and talk to me. Did some clients see it, by chance? Probably. Q. When at least 65 people reacted to that post; right? A. Yeah, which isn't great numbers if you have a thousand, 1500 friends. Q. Don't beat yourself up. 65 is fine. And I apologize if you answered this. I really don't remember. But on page 11 of Exhibit No. 8, do you know why there was a blank there when it says received contact info from and then there's a blank? A. No, I don't. It definitely was not intentional. Q. And so again, with S , you initiated that contact with him after your resignation; right? A. Yes. Q. He didn't reach out to you first? A. No. Q. If you go back to page 7. A. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm here -- oh, 7. I was on 6. Okay. Q. Is the first name D ? A.D R. Q. And did you ask D for contact information? A. I did. Q. And then it was received on Facebook? A. It was. I don't -- I don't recall if she sent me anything back on Facebook, actually. I think she might have texted or called me directly. Q. And then it says a little further down the page that D sent J V contact info -A. Uh-huh. Q. -- at 9:45 a.m.? A. Yes. Q. Is that because you asked D to send J 's contact information? A. I did, over the phone. ?Q. And then you reached out to J A. I did. Q. And you told J that you resigned? A. I did. Q. And that you were going to TerraWealth? A. I did. Q. Can you go to page 18? At the bottom it will say page 18. It's not the 18th page. Actually, 17. At the final star in that paragraph, there is a blank after N . Do you know why? A. Yeah, I don't think my wife knew what her last name was. Q. Do you know what N 's last name is? A. Yes. It's N C . She's a sister of R. Q. So is this your wife having these communications -A. No. Q. -- or you? A. These are my communications. Q. And you didn't -- I'm just trying to figure it out. You know N 's last name? A. Yes. Q. But you didn't tell your wife N 's last name? A. I probably did. I'm learning how to delegate to so-called having my wife as a secretary, and, clearly, there's some mistakes. MR. ALONSO: I just want to state for the record. We are preserving the spousal privilege. I don't see any problem with you asking him questions about these documents and me maintaining that objection. If you disagree, I would ask that we talk through it now; otherwise, I think we can proceed. MR. TURMAN: To the extent that she's involved in preparing these documents, I'm going to ask about that and the source of information, but, in general, to the extent she's not involved with these. MR. ALONSO: Thank you. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. If you can go to page 18 now. We are talking about J J, and in that star -A. Yeah. Q. -- it says received contact info from blank? A. Uh-huh. Q. Who was the information received from? A. That would have been received from B- -- BNI. It stands for Business Networking International, and it's a referral networking group. That's where that client came from. So a lady in that BNI had given me that contact. So within that, there is a report that you can get that I was able to pull, and I don't, again, know why. That's where that came from. Q. But you don't know why that information is not in here? A. No. Q. And you may or may not have told the person who was writing this down where it came from? A. I would have and/or my wife might not have known, but -- so she might not have made that note. Maybe she should have put a reference to refer to me about that later, but that is where that contact came from. Q. Uh-huh. When did you receive that contact information? A. At that time, after I resigned, you can get a report from your BNI, and I was able to pull that. And then also confirm that that information was correct with people that had sent that referral to me directly before. Q. You said "at the time." At what time did you receive that contact information? A. I don't -- I don't know. It would have been after the 16th of September, but I don't know specifically when. Q. Can you go to page 22, please? I got Dr. C here and it -A. Yep. Same thing. Q. -- and we have the same thing where it says received contact and there's a blank. Where did you receive that contact from? A. BNI, same exact thing. Q. From a list you received from BNI? A. Yes. And the same client actually referred me to -- the J J referred me to the same Dr. C H. Q. And now on some of these handwritten pages it says -A. What page are you looking at? Q. I'll find one and I'll tell you. BNI is referenced on a lot of these pages? A. Yeah. Q. But you don't know why it's not listed on these particular ones we've been discussing? A. Yeah. I know those ones are specific BNI. was in my BNI group, so I saw her everyDr. C HThursday. Q. Did you have an account with whitepages.com? A. I did have, yes. Q. When did you open that account? A. After September 16th. Q. And why did you open that account? A. Because that is a public website that you can pay a subscription for and get contact information. Q. And you use it to access contact information for your clients who were clients at Primerica? A. I tried to get an accurate number to try to get ahold of them. Q. So you could tell them that you were resigning from Primerica? A. That I resigned from -- yeah. After, past tense. Q. Yes. Resigned, past tense. And you were joining TerraWealth? A. Correct. Q. Let's look at page 29. Do you know why that information is scratched out in the middle of the page? A. Huh-uh. Q. Do you know what was written there before it was scratched out? A. No, I do not. Q. Who would know? A. I -- I don't know. I don't think anyone would. Q. Who wrote it? A. My wife. Q. So she would know, if she remembered? A. Yeah, I don't think she's going to remember. Q. We would have to ask her; right? She'd have a better chance of knowing than you? A. Possibly. Q. If you flip to page 31, this is for clients M A.R . Q. There's a scratched-out portion there and you -can you see what that said? A. It looks like it says reached or received underneath. Q. So it looks like someone wrote "received" first? A. Yeah, I think so. Q. And then scratched it out? A. And put "reached" out. Q. Because you initiated the contact to the client? A. I did, yes. There you go. Q. Got one of them. A. Better notetaking from my wife. Q. Let's go to page 32. Can you tell what is behind those scratched-out portions? A. No. I think she just might have spelled the name wrong or spelled a word wrong or something. I know there's not anything of value there. Q. But you don't know for sure? A. No. Q. And you didn't write it? A. No. Q. And your wife is the one who wrote it? A. Correct. Q. Let's go to page 42. A. That's -Q. That's your handwriting; right? A. That is mine. Q. Okay. I was right. That is what I thought. A. Wow, there's a substantial difference in handwriting. Q. How did you know this individual listed on page 42? A. Which individual? Q. Oh, at the top of the page. A. Oh, Alijah -- Alijah Okoro? Q. Yes. A. Was life-licensed with Primerica, and he would have been on my team at Primerica. Q. Is Alijah at TerraWealth now? A. I do not believe he's affiliated. Q. Do you have any reason to believe that he will be affiliated in the future? A. He wants to, but I told him I don't think it's a great fit. Q. Why? A. Because there's costs in running a business and he hasn't really done anything. So it's not really worth his time, in my opinion. Q. Let's go to page 50. Is A J a current client? A. Yes. Q. And in the notes it says client is glad Taylor left Primerica. Do you see that? A. Yes. Q. Why was the client glad that you left Primerica? A. He didn't like Primerica and since he was -- this was per our phone conversation with him -- or my -- my phone conversation with him, he didn't like Primerica. He didn't like the technology. He didn't like logging in to see his accounts. He thought the performance was poor and the investments inside of them, and he learned more about the industry since he had started a new job at -- I don't recall the name of his financial firm that he's working at. He's kind of like a secretarial-type position there or something. Q. Did y'all talk about the technology at Primerica during this conversation? A. He just said -- those are things that he basically said in a kind of summary nutshell. I don't remember any specific, other than he didn't like logging into the client portal. Q. Did he have any questions about TerraWealth? A. Yes. Q. What questions did he ask? A. What investments were available, does he have to keep them in the same investments, can he change it, what would fees be. Q. Did he ask about technology? A. He did. I believe. I don't... Q. And you at that point in time had enough information to answer his questions; right? A. I think --Yes. Q. Or at least most of his questions? A. Yeah, exactly. Q. And you got that information from Josh Mauk? A. Yes. Q. And other people affiliated with TerraWealth? A. Yes. Q. Did anybody else that you spoke with --Let me make that question more narrow. You spoke with a good amount of your Primerica clients after you resigned; correct? A. Yes. Q. Did any of them have anything negative to say about Primerica? A. Yes. Q. Who? A.R H. Q. Who else? A. His name is C V , but we call him -his middle name is B , so we call him B . But C V is his legal name. Q. Can you spell the last name, please? A.V . Q. I'm glad you spelled that. Who else? A. None that come to my memory. A J , but... Q. We already covered him. A. Yes. Q. After you told Mr. Jabout the offerings and technology and other aspects of TerraWealth, do you have an understanding as to whether he liked the things that you told him? A. He was willing to try them out because of the relationship that we have. Q. And the things that you told him about TerraWealth? A. I don't think it had as much to do with TerraWealth as it did the relationship. Q. Did A specifically tell you that? A. Not specifically, but he was potentially going to move his money to the financial firm that he was working at. The reason he didn't is he doesn't know if he will stay there long terms. So he liked the idea of in the short term continuing to work with me because he likes and trusts me. Q. And he also now works with you while you work at TerraWealth; correct? A. Ask that again. Q. He -- he currently works with you; right? A. At TerraWealth, yes. I mean, he doesn't work with me. I'm his advisor. Q. Thank you for clarifying. Yes. He is one of your clients currently? A. Yes. Q. And he was happy when you told him about TerraWealth technology? A. I wouldn't say that I got that response, no. Q. What response did you get regarding TerraWealth's technology? A. I don't recall any specific response, other than I'll -- you know, I'm happy to continue to work with you and move stuff over and let's see how it works and looks. Q. But you explained to him that TerraWealth had different offerings than Primerica; right? A. Yes. Yes. Q. You explained to him that TerraWealth had better technology than Primerica, in your opinion? A. In my opinion. Q. What did R -- is it H ? A. H . Q. How do you spell that? A.H . Q. What did he have to say about Primerica? A. That he didn't like that specifically what you read about it, that it has a lot of negative connotation online. Q. Did -A. A lot. Q. Did Mr. H ask you about TerraWealth's reputation? A. No. Q. Did he ask you about the reputation of anyone else other than you affiliated with TerraWealth? A. No. Q. What else did Mr. H have to say about Primerica during that phone call? A. Just -- that's all I recall and remember. Q. How about C , who you referred to as Billy? A.B . Q.B . A. His middle name is R and he goes by B . Q.B V ? A. Yes. Q. What did he have to say about Primerica during this phone call? A. He -- for that -- every time I ever talked to him hated Primerica's client -- client portal. So he was like, probably every time I did a review with him for three or four years that he has been a client and become a -- a close friend, complained about the technology and the client portal. He wanted to get his accounts specifically big enough so he could move over to TD Ameritrade, which you have to have a minimum of 25,000 to be a managed account because TD Ameritrade offered a better technology and better, like, an app and things like that that he could log in. I swear he asked me every time if Primerica was going to create an app. Q. Is B currently one of your clients? A. Yes. Q. During that phone call did you talk to him about TerraWealth's technology? A. I did. Q. What did you tell him? A. I said, you should be ex- -- I don't remember exact phraseology, but it was around about of you're going to be excited because Fidelity has an app. Q. And it finally fixed the problem that B was having with Primerica? A. Just that specifically he was excited to be able to have an app and login, yeah. Q. And you knew he'd be excited about that based on your conversations; right? A. I did, yes. Q. Can you go to page 62, please. Do you know why there is no contact information on this page? A. No. Probably just my wife forgot to put it. I know I got that when I talked to him that specific day. He was in our meeting that we have every single Thursday and I talked to him in person and pulled him aside. Q. So then you -- you on September 29th put that contact info in your phone? A. I did, yes. Q. Got it. A. Because he was there in person. Q. We're not going to have to go through these one by one, but you'd agree with me that you asked several people to give you contact information for other people; right? A. In the form of a referral, because they had already had their contact information, so, yes. Q. You would ask your clients for the contact information from other people who you worked with at Primerica; correct? MR. ALONSO: I'm not sure I understand. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. I'll -- I'll go back, yeah. You had Primerica clients? A. Yes. Q. After you resigned, you talked to some of these clients? A. Yes. Q. During these conversations, you'd say, Hey, do you have the contact information for this other person; right? A. Yes. Q. And then they would -- the person you were talking to would send you that contact information; correct? A. Yes. MR. TURMAN: That is the only objection I'll agree with. Guaranteed. That was not good. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. I've heard a lot about maple syrup this week. What's-- what's that about? Why does everyone deal with maple syrup? Is it -- is it -A. Everybody? Q. Is it a client gift or is it a -- a Primerica client that makes maple syrup? A. It is not a Primerica client. It's one of our clients in Wisconsin that has their own maple syrup business. Q. Got it. Okay. What -A. Just a side note question? MR. ALONSO: I would ask that only opposing counsel be the one that asks question, and I would just respectfully ask you to answer his questions. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. What -- what are the different ways that you communicate with people? And I'll list some and then you tell me if there's any others. We have in-person conversations, Zooms, phone calls, texting, e-mail, Facebook Messenger. How else do you communicate with people? A. That's pretty much. I mean, yeah, I would say that's a pretty accurate depiction. Q. Do you use -A. Some more than others. Q. Do you use any other -- I know you don't use Clubhouse anymore. Do you use any other apps or platforms to communicate with other people? A. As far as clients? Q. We'll start there. A. The only other one I use for a client specifically was Signal, and that one was for a client was because he is -- I had Facebook messaged him. He's in the military and he is stationed in -- oversees somewhere and can't really communicate with -- in that regard. So he is like why don't I call you through Signal or something like that. Q. Is it your understanding that Signal is end to end encrypted on both ends? A. I don't know what that means. Q. What did you and T talk about on that Signal call? A. The same conversation I had with every client. Q. Is T related to Paul? A. Yes. That's his nephew. And Paul asked me three or four or five, whatever how long it's been, to take care of him because Paul wasn't licensed in the state of Arizona because Paul's in Wisconsin. Q. That was my next question. A. So I've taken care him. Q. Is T currently one of your clients at TerraWealth? A. Yes. Q. You had a lot of your clients sign a declaration. Do you remember that? A. Yes. Q. And you don't know who drafted that declaration, do you? A. I -- I do not. Q. And these -- this declaration was a template; right? A. Yeah. Q. You didn't have somebody draft a declaration specifically based on your conversations with a particular client? A. Correct. Q. How did you receive the template of those declarations? A. I don't remember. Q. If you were going to investigate on your own and try to figure that out, what steps would you take? A. I don't know. Q. Would you look in e-mails? A. I have the blank template saved on my desktop but I don't know how I got it. I think it might have been in a Zoom call that Joseph put in there for us to use. But I don't remember specifically. Q. So you believe that you got the template declara- -- declaration from your attorney? A. I do believe that. Q. Did you ever ask anybody to make revisions to that declaration? A. No. Q. Did you receive a template of this declaration before you even had these conversations with your clients? A. I don't remember timelines. Q. Do you remember what month you received a template of this declaration? A. Probably September. Q. You'd agree with me that you --I will step back. You have a good amount of clients who were your clients at Primerica and are currently your client at TerraWealth; correct? A. Yes. Q. And you guided them through the logistics in things they needed to do to transfer their accounts; right? A. Yes. Q. And you made that easy for them? A. I tried to help them so it was. Q. You told them how to get information out of their Primerica account? A. To get a statement. Q. You told them how to get the statement you needed? A. Yeah, or that they needed for the -Q. That they needed to give you to be able to make the transfer? A. Yes. Q. Did you ever make the RVP level at Primerica? A. I did. Q. Did you sign an RVP agreement? A. I did. Q. So we have that you signed the base agreement when you started; right? THE COURT REPORTER: Is that a "yes"? THE WITNESS: Yes. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. It's getting later in the day, I know. We have that you signed the RVP agreement later; correct? A. Yes. Q. And about when was that? A. End of June of 2022. Q. To your knowledge, did you sign any other agreements with Primerica? A. Not to my knowledge. Q. Who knew that you were -- or your dad knew that you were an RVP; right? A. Yes. Q. And Klaine? A. Yes. Q. And Korey Doucette? A. Yes. Q. Did anyone at TerraWealth know you were an RVP? A. Yes, I do believe Josh knew. Q. And Josh is the president of TerraWealth; right? A. Yes. Q. You agree with me that it's common knowledge among people involved in Primerica that as part of the process of becoming an RVP, you sign an RVP agreement; correct? A. It's probably not common knowledge, but a good majority know it. Q. And Josh Mauk was an RVP, wasn't he? A. Yes. Q. So it's a fair conclusion that he knew you signed an RVP agreement; correct? A. Yes. Q. And he was working with Roy Matlock; right? MR. ALONSO: Object to the question. It -- it asks for this witness to speculate. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. You would agree with me that Josh Mauk currently works with Roy Matlock; right? A. Works with currently? Q. Today. He works with Roy Matlock? A. They both are affiliated at TerraWealth. Q. In September 2022, he worked with Roy Matlock? A. Yes. Q. And he also worked with Duane Morrow? MR. ALONSO: Object to the request. Asks this witness to speculate. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. To your knowledge, in September of 2022, did Josh Mauk work with Duane Morrow? MR. ALONSO: Same object -- same objection. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. To your knowledge, in September 2022 did Josh Mauk work with Scott Leonard? MR. ALONSO: Same objection. THE WITNESS: Yes, I believe. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. And you know they were all on the leadership team of TerraWealth before you joined; right? A. Yes. Q. Because that's what it said on the website? A. Public information. Q. And that's what they told you? A. Well, it's public information on the website. Q. But they told you, too? MR. ALONSO: Object to the question. THE WITNESS: I don't think that it was ever specifically told. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. But you were specifically told that Josh was the president; correct? A. No. I don't think I was ever specifically told Josh was president. Q. What did Josh tell you his role was with TerraWealth? A. He is the financial advisor serving clients and he, you know, was maybe a founder of TerraWealth, but I don't think he's ever said I'm the president or CMO, but I know that because it's on the website. Q. I'm going to show you what is marked as Exhibit 9. (Exhibit 9 was marked for identification.) BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Mr. Thompson, have you seen this document before? A. I don't -- I don't know. I don't know if this was again a part of that packet that I got with my subpoena. Q. I'll represent to you that it is not. It probably looks a little similar. But this -A. Okay. Q. -- I'll represent to you are your responses and objections to plaintiffs' subpoena for deposition and requests for production of documents. Do you see that title? A. Yes, the big bold in the middle? Q. Yes. A. Yes. Q. I'll represent to you that your attorney provided those to us. And -A. Okay. Q. -- I want to confirm, you said you have not seen this document before? A. I do believe I have not. Q. If you can please go on the page 2, look at request No. 1, I would ask that you read request No. 2 quietly to yourself to make the life -A. What page is that? Q. Page 2. And -- and it says specific responses to defendant's requests and then No. 1, under that. A. I'm not seeing it. Q. You see the underlined part? A. Yes, wow. Okay. And then where it starts: Communications? Q. And then I would like for you to read that quietly to yourself so the court reporter doesn't have to type it out and just read the request. And please let me know when you've done that. A. To what spot do I stop? Q. On the next page, the last word is David May, the last words. A. Okay. Okay. Q. Did you search for any communications responsive to this request? A. Yes. Q. Did you find any? A. Yes. Q. Did you provide them all to your attorney? A. Yes, to the best of my ability. Q. Do you know if they have all been produced to the plaintiffs in this case? A. I -- I -- yeah, to the best of my ability. Q. Thanks for not guessing. A. You already got some. Q. I mean, you don't know. Where did you search for these kind of communications? A. My phone and computer. Q. Where on your phone did you search? A. Texts, e-mails, even photos. And Facebook, I guess, would be within my phone. Q. Where on your computer? A. E-mails and then any -- what is it called? -your hard drive or computer drive, or just your files on your computer. Q. Do you know if your laptop is backed up anywhere? A. I -- I know you said I'm young -- should be good at technology, but I truly don't know how to. It's not backed to anything that I know of. Q. And you don't know of it -- whether it's backed up in the cloud somewhere? A. Yeah, I don't. Q. I say that like we all know what that even means. A. Right. Q. What e-mail accounts did you search through? A. My personal. Q. And what are those e-mail addresses for your personal e-mails? A. @icloud.com. And @gmail.com. Q. Did you look through your TerraWealth e-mail? A. I didn't have that prior to resigning. Q. But you had it between January 1st, 2021, and present; right? A. Yes. Q. But you didn't search through your TerraWealth e-mail; correct? A. Correct. Q. I'm going to instruct you not to delete any responsive e-mails from your TerraWealth e-mail, please, and we'll be talking to your attorney about a supplemental production. A. Actually, can you ask your question again about my TerraWealth e-mail? Q. Did you search your TerraWealth e-mail account to see if you had any communications responsive to request No. 1? A. And communications responsive to these specific people? Q. That would be -- yes, for request No. 1, yes, including TerraWealth which -A. Yes. Q. -- is more than one person. A. Yes, I don't want to say I didn't search. I was saying more so I didn't find anything through my TerraWealth e-mail in -- in that regards. And so, yes. And I will continue to preserve, if I do find information. Q. I appreciate that. After you joined TerraWealth, did you bring over any other representatives who were formerly at Primerica? A. Meaning, that were on my downline team? Q. Sure. A. Yes. Kate Stuart and Montell Hawkins. And, technically, Kate Stuart I think has a Terra e-mail, but she's not really affiliated -- she's -- I don't think has appointed her life license with -- or done anything. So she's not... Q. And when did Kate Stuart come over to TerraWealth? A. Similar time frame. Maybe end of September or same -- same. I don't know exactly specifically. Q. When did Montell Hawkins come over to TerraWealth? A. His was more towards the end of October, actually. Q. So you know that that was after you were already at TerraWealth? A. Yes. Q. And you communicated with other people who worked at TerraWealth about, Hey, Montell's going to come over and join us; right? A. I think it would have just been with the attorney to go how -MR. ALONSO: Object to the extent the question seeks attorney/client privileged communications. I would ask you to please answer the question but do not divulge attorney/client privileged communications. THE WITNESS: So ask your question again, please. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Did you communicate with anybody about the prospect of Montell Hawkins joining TerraWealth? A. Yes, I believe so. Q. Who? A. I believe my attorney and potentially my mom or dad, but I don't recall specifics. Q. How did you communicate with your mom and dad about Montell Hawkins coming to join TerraWealth? A. In person or phone call. And he specifically was delayed because he left the country for a wedding, so... Q. Walk me through the process for bringing over Montell Hawkins. Do you know -MR. ALONSO: Object to the question that it assumes this individual was brought over. MR. TURMAN: And we can just say "Objection to form," and that'll preserve everything. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. You were glad for Montell Hawkins to join you at TerraWealth, weren't you? A. I was indifferent. Q. Why were you indifferent? A. Because he is not, like, a big producer. He does a little bit of business. Q. Why is he not a big producer, in your opinion? A. I was going to say -- maybe work ethic, motivation, drive, discipline. I don't know. Effort. Market. Probably his own personal market and contacts. Q. Walk me through the process of what had to be done, to your knowledge, for Montell Hawkins to join TerraWealth. And I'll start off with a particular question. Do you know who had to sign off? A. No. MR. ALONSO: I'm sorry. I'm going ask you to let him finish his question. THE WITNESS: Sorry. MR. ALONSO: And then you can answer. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Do you know who had to sign off and say, yes, we want Montell Hawkins to work at TerraWealth? A. No, I do not. Q. Do you know who your attorney spoke with about Montell Hawkins coming over? A. No, I do not. Q. Do you know who your dad spoke to about Montell Hawkins coming over? A. No, I do not. Q. So what process did Montell Hawkins have to undertake to be onboarded at TerraWealth? A. I believe it was the same process as all of us. Q. Which was? A. He resigned, and then contacted David May to get appointed or affiliated, whatever the term would be. Q. What is David May's title or role at TerraWealth? A. I -- I don't know a title or role, but -Q. Did -I will let you finish. A. I was just saying, but I -- he was who I have contacted about licensing questions. Q. In your opinion, is Mr. May part of a leadership team? A. I would say he is a part of TerraWealth's home office. I don't know how you would define leadership versus founders versus partners. I don't know. Q. So, surely, you communicated with Montell Hawkins about the possibility of him joining with TerraWealth? A. Yes, via -- via phone calls. Q. When were those phone calls? A. September, and October after his wedding. Q. Those calls, did they all happen after you resigned? A. Yes. Q. What did you talk about? A. His wedding, him and his wife, his trip, how that went. And then answered any questions that maybe he might have had. Q. What questions did he have? A. I don't recall any specific questions. Q. How did the topic of TerraWealth even come up? A. He had been a part of those TerraWealth meetings from maybe July to the month of August to early September. He was a part of all of those Zoom meetings. Whether he was on or not, I don't -- I didn't keep track. Q. And those were the meetings -- correct me if I'm wrong -- but those were the meetings where Josh Mauk was talking about TerraWealth? A. Yes, and answering all of our questions. Q. About the technology? A. Tools, resources. Q. Offerings? A. Yes. Q. There was talk about compensation on those calls; right? A. Yes. Q. I'll make sure I'm clear so the record is clear. On the Zoom calls with Josh Mauk, you talked about compensation; correct? A. Yes. Q. What did you learn about compensation at TerraWealth? A. That they hadn't finished figuring it out. Q. What was your impression of how you would be compensated upon joining TerraWealth? A. I wouldn't be compensated for joining TerraWealth, I guess. Q. I will rephrase that. So you're saying you wouldn't get a bonus for coming over; right? So what was your -THE COURT REPORTER: Was that -THE WITNESS: Yes. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. What was your impression of how, after joining TerraWealth, you would be compensated? A. Based on production and what's maybe -- the correct term maybe would be sales contract that you have, you'd be comp'd. Q. Have you signed any contracts with TerraWealth? A. Yes. Q. What kind of contract? A. I don't know what they would be specifically, but sign-on agreements with TerraWealth. Q. And you would agree with me that the contract talks about protecting confidential information? A. I don't recall -- or I don't know. Q. Have you read it? A. Not in great detail. Q. Do you know if your contract with TerraWealth is any different from any of the other deponents' contracts? A. I do not know. Q. Do you know if it's different from your dad's contract? A. No idea. Q. So when you're talking to Montell Hawkins after September 16th, 2022, how did the topic of TerraWealth come up? A. I don't remember specifics how -- how it came up. Q. Do you remember who brought it up? A. No. Q. What questions did Montell have about TerraWealth? A. I don't think any specific at that point in time. Q. Did you tell him about your experience in the early days after joining TerraWealth? A. Not anything specific that I remember, no. Q. Did y'all talk about products? A. No. He was extremely busy because he had his wedding and he was studying for his Series 65 license. So he wasn't, like, actively doing a lot of anything. Q. Well, If he attended the Zooms, he knew about the products, too; right? A. He would have had basically the same information I would have known at that time. Q. Did he ask you about what steps he should take to join TerraWealth? A. He, I believe, would have known those steps from -- like the Cape Securities, he was on or would have been or -- I don't know exactly. Q. Did he tell you that he was going to be joining TerraWealth or planned on it? A. He did seem to be excited about that opportunity. Q. What did you need to do from that point to make sure that he would be in your downline when he joined TerraWealth? A. I think whether -- if once he did come over, just let one of the home office people, which would either be, I believe, David May or Duane Morrow, know that this person would be on my team or downline. Q. And did you let David May know that he -- that Montell Hawkins was coming over? A. I don't -- I don't think until after the fact. I don't know specific timelines. Q. In the month that Montell Hawkins came over, did you ever talk to the David May about Mr. Hawkins? A. I did speak with him in person in Charlotte. I -- I remember about helping him get onboarded or maybe get appointed with -- for the life insurance specifically. I don't know, though. Making sure he had a Terra e-mail. I don't remember. Q. Have you helped Mr. Hawkins with onboarding? A. No, not really. A little bit, but... Q. How did you learn that Kate Stuart wanted to join TerraWealth? A. I had told her about the possibility, I believe maybe Julyish time frame that we were exploring and looking. And she's a little bit of a different person. She never really wanted to be a rep as an agent. I initially had contact with her to get life licensed with me, and if you help me maybe with like paperwork, I can split life sales with you and things like that. So she's not -- really that's why she's not even done anything or anything, so... Q. Do you know if she plans on doing anything? A. She is -- I don't know people say a lot of thing, so I don't know. Q. I got it. A. I'm not really holding my breath. She's a sweet lady, though. Q. If you can flip over to page 4 and please look at request No. 2 and read that quietly to yourself, and let me know when you're ready to talk about it. A. Okay. THE VIDEOGRAPHER: I apologize for interrupting. Can I have you move that mike all the way up. It's just -- it's really not a fan of your zipper. THE WITNESS: I'd take my thing off, but it's chilly. THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Thank you. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. You would agree that you work with several representatives at TerraWealth who used to work at Primerica; correct? A. What do you mean by "work with"? Q. Your dad, the Doucettes. You work with them; right? A. Yes. Q. Your brother? A. Yes. Q. His wife? A. Yes. Q. And you've communicated with them in writing since you joined TerraWealth; right? A. I mean, what do you mean by "in writing"? Q. Text? E-mail? A. And communications about TerraWealth? Q. Oh. I'm not making it that narrow yet. We'll get there. A. I don't -- I -- possibly. Probably. Q. Since September 16th, 2022, you've texted your dad? A. Yes. Q. You've texted the Doucettes? A. I have texted Klaine. Q. Not Korey? A. I -- I don't have a lot of -- I mean, they might have texted me and maybe asked a question or something, but I don't have any specific recall. Q. Texted your brother? A. Andy? Q. Uh-huh. A. Yes. Q. All these people and you also probably texted before September 16th, 2022; correct? A. Correct. Q. And you've deleted a good portion of those texts; right? A. Yes. Q. All of them? A. Yes. Q. Did anybody -- just answer my question. It's going to be a yes/no question. Did anybody instruct you to delete all those texts? MR. ALONSO: Object to the question to the extent it seeks attorney/client privileged communications. I'd ask you not to respond to the question insofar as it relates to attorney/client privileged communications. Other than that, I would ask you to fully answer the question. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. And it was a yes/no question. A. Yes. Q. Did anybody other than your attorney instruct you to delete all those text messages? A. Yes. Q. Who? A. Josh Mauk. Q. When? A. I don't remember time frame. Q. We know it was before -A. We resigned. MR. ALONSO: I would ask to let him ask the question, let him finish, and then you can answer. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. So we know it was before you resigned. Was it shortly before you resigned? A. I don't remember. Q. Was it on one of the early Zoom calls in April, May? A. I don't think so, no. Q. Was it after everyone -- I'll restart that question to make it a little more precise. Was it after you had decided that you were going to join TerraWealth? A. No. And Josh wouldn't have known that. Q. Was it in the summer of 2022? A. I believe it probably would have been closer -around mid-Augustish, we'll say. Q. Did Mr. Mauk ever talk to you about this Georgia lawsuit? A. Which one was that one? There is a lot of -Q. That -- that's fair. That is the one that we're here for today. A. And what is "that"? Because we are talking about my client documents. Does that have to do with the... Q. Very much so. A. Okay. I think just mentioned that there is litigations and things going on. Q. So he didn't necessarily get into the details with you? A. No. Q. When did he reference that there was litigation going on? A. I think from the very beginning with Roy and Primerica. I mean... Q. And those calls were around April/May time period? A. Yeah. And I even knew that before I even had any communication with Josh because Peter Schneider and Glenn got up on Primerica and did a webinar talking about that they're going to be suing each other. That was all over Primerica Online in Marchish. And they had done -- Peter, Glenn, and whoever else at the home office had done multiple -- maybe not multiple. That might be a stretch -- but they had done a couple public -because a wide range of people were using SalesTeamPro and -- that were affiliated with Primerica, so everyone kind of was like, what's going on? Q. I want to make sure I have timeline right. You think around mid-August, Josh Mauk to -instructed you to delete all of your text messages, including text messages between you and other Primerica representatives; correct? A. It wasn't as specific as that, but it was making sure mainly that I don't take client data or client information with me. I mean... Q. But based on what he told you, you understood that you should delete all your text messages with Klaine; right? A. I never understood or didn't understand that. My inference, inference, if that's the right word -- my understanding, we'll just say that's easier, is Klaine is a client of Primerica, he's not my client, but he's a client of Primerica, so I can't have his contact information. So I tried to maybe be overcautious that I didn't take any client of Primerica information with me. And that's the communication I understood from Josh. Q. And so based on what Josh told you in mid-August, 2022, you deleted text messages with Klaine; right? A. I believe so, yes, and his phone number, anything like that. Q. You also deleted text messages with your dad, Tim Thompson; correct? A. Yes. Q. You also deleted text messages between you and your brother, Andy Thompson; correct? A. Yes. All clients of Primerica. MR. TURMAN: Objection. Nonresponsive. There wasn't a question pending. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Prior to September 16, 2022, did you have any texts with Sammie Thompson? A. Can you ask that again? Q. Prior to your resignation from Primerica -A. Yeah. Q. -- had you ever texted Sammie? A. Individually? Q. Or in a group? A. I don't recall. I would speculate and say probably. Q. And you also deleted those text messages? A. Yes. Q. Based on your understanding of what Josh Mauk told you? A. Correct. Q. Did you also delete text messages between you and people who were your downline at Primerica? A. Yes, because, again, they were clients of Primerica, so that is my understanding to be cautious and protective. MR. TURMAN: Objection. Nonresponsive to everything after "Yes." BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Back to request No. 2, what did you do -- what steps did you take to see if you had responsive communications in your possession? A. The same as the first request. My e-mails. I went through my phone and computer and then, like you asked before, text messages, and e-mails. I wouldn't have used any really other stuff than those that I remember or recall. The same process. Q. Have you texted or e-mailed your dad since you joined TerraWealth? A. Yes. Q. Have you texted or e-mail Klaine since you joined TerraWealth? A. Yes. Q. Have you texted or e-mailed any individuals who were in your downline at Primerica since you joined TerraWealth? A. Ask that again. Q. So we talked earlier about the people who were in your downline at Primerica? A. Yes. Q. Since you joined TerraWealth, have you texted or e-mailed any of them? A. Yes. Q. Have you texted --I'll make this more precise. Since you joined TerraWealth, have you texted or e-mailed your brother, Andy? A. Yes. Q. Do you still have those communications? A. No. I -- I don't know. I -- you know, I don't know. Q. Since you joined TerraWealth, all this communications we're talking about would be communications on or after September 16th, 2022; is that fair? A. Yes. Q. Do you understand? Okay. So for any communications after that date with these people we've talked about, have you deleted those communications? A. I -- I know I had a automatic delete text message thing that I didn't know about. And then I remember on one of those calls -MR. ALONSO: Object to the question to the extent it seeks attorney/client privileged communications. Feel free to answer this question. You can answer about what you did, but do not disclose communications between you and your attorney. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. So you had an automatic deletion feature for your text messages on your phone; is that correct? A. Yes. Q. When was that feature activated? A. I don't remember activating it ever. Q. Do you know if anyone else did on your phone? A. No. Q. When did you learn that that feature was on your phone? A. I don't remember. Q. Was it after you joined TerraWealth? A. Yes, I believe. I don't remember if it was before or after or later. Q. Do you know how long your phone was set to retain text messages before they were automatically deleted? A. Within it, I think the setting is 30 days and that -- I didn't even know that that was a feature. Q. Have you since disabled that feature? A. Yes. Q. To your knowledge, did your phone automatically delete text messages with representatives who were formally with Primerica but are now with TerraWealth? A. I don't know. Q. To your knowledge, did that feature on your phone delete all text messages predating your resignation? A. I don't know. Q. What steps would you do to find out that information? A. I don't know. Q. You could just look at your phone; right? A. I -- I guess so. I'm not sure. Q. To your knowledge -- to your knowledge, when is the last time that any of these text messages have been automatically deleted? A. I don't know. Q. Have you ever looked into finding out the answer to that question? A. I don't know. Q. I am assuming you have, but I instruct you to make sure nothing else is deleted going forward, and it sounds like you have corrected that feature; is that correct? A. To my best understanding, yeah. Q. But you still do have texts on your phone between you and your dad? A. Yes. Q. And your brother, Andy? A. Yes. Q. And Klaine Doucette? A. I -- maybe. I don't know. Q. Did you look for those in response to request No. 2? A. I -- I remember looking very vividly through my phone and photos, and, so, I did my best at the time. Q. Do you know of any other people who have been deposed this week had that same automatic deletion feature on their phone? A. I have -- I do not. I have no idea. Q. Other than your attorney, have you talked to anybody else about the fact that your phone automatically deleted text messages? A. Not that I remember or recall, no. Q. So you haven't talked to your dad about that? A. No. Q. So we have a lot of clients we talked about that were clients at Primerica and are now clients at TerraWealth; right? A. Uh-huh. Q. What paperwork or communications do you need to fill out in order to facilitate the process of onboarding them at TerraWealth? A. Transfer paperwork. Q. Have you filled out transfer paperwork for any of those clients who were clients at Primerica? A. I have not specifically filled out paperwork, no. Q. Has anybody filled out transfer paperwork for those clients? A. Yes. Q. Who? A. I don't know exactly who, but the Bison Advisors' team has filled out and done the back-end paperwork process. Q. Have you ever communicated with anyone with Bison about those transfers? A. Yes. Q. In writing? A. Yeah, maybe e-mails and shared folders, communications. Q. Like a share file or an FTP server? A. Yes, I don't know what that server thing is, but a share file, or shared folder or some sort. Q. Do you know what kind, if it's a Dropbox or box account or? A. It's literally a shared drive is what it says. Q. Okay. A. And I think it's a Microsoft Excel sheet, but I don't know. Q. To your knowledge, do you still have those communications? A. Not -- I -- I don't know. Q. Do you know if you've deleted them? A. I have not. Q. Do you know if anyone else has deleted them? A. I don't know. Q. So for request No. 3, on page 5, if you could please read that to yourself. A. Okay. Q. What did you do to search for these type of communications? A. Searched on my phone and computer. Q. Did you search your TerraWealth e-mail account? A. Yes. Q. Did you find any responsive communications? A. Not to the best of my ability. Q. What -- how did you search for documents responsive to this request in your TerraWealth e-mail account? A. By scrolling through, I guess. Q. Did you read every e-mail? A. Skimmed. Q. Did you perform any word searches? A. I don't necessarily know how to do that, no. Q. How do you organize your calendar? A. On, like, Google calendar or like a day planner or like what do I get up and do first in the morning? Q. Thank you for asking for clarity. Do you use any particular software or documents to organize your calendar and your schedule? A. I use Google calendar. Q. What kind of information do you put in Google calendar? A. Not -- an e-mail. Like I'll invite a client. Like, if it's a client meeting, I'll invite the client to the meeting or it's a lot of just, you know, BNI networking at this time. So it's on the calendar, you know. Product training at this time, so it's on the calendar, or personal stuff where it's my baby's doctor appointment and I just put that and maybe the address of the location. Q. How long have you used Google calendars to kind of manage your schedule? MR. ALONSO: If I may. I think I might have to pick up my lunch at the front desk here momentarily. I might just step out and bring it right back. I don't know that we need to go off the record. It will just take a minute. MR. TURMAN: Yeah. Let's -MR. ALONSO: I just don't want the delivery person standing in the lobby with it. MR. TURMAN: Let's just go off the record just so we can manage the time. Is that all right, Mr. Alonso? MR. ALONSO: Yes. MR. TURMAN: Okay. THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record. The time is now 11:57. (A recess was taken from 11:57 a.m. until 12:05 p.m.) THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record. The time is now 12:05. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Mr. Thompson, welcome back. We are getting there, man. We're getting there. And I think the question I asked right before we took a quick break was how long you had used Google calendars to manage your schedule. A. A couple years. Q. Did you have -- earlier we talked about some of the Zoom meetings you had with Josh Mauk. Did you ever note that on your calendar that you were going to have those Zooms? A. Maybe sometimes but not always necessarily. Q. Did you search your calendar to see if you had any of those in response to this subpoena? A. I did. Q. Did you give your attorney any calendar information? A. I did not. Q. I would ask you, just like everything else, I don't think you will, but I'd ask you just not to delete that calendar information, please. Same question. I believe you said there were -how many Zoom meetings did you have prior to leaving Primerica that Mr. Leonard attended? A. Who is Mr. Leonard? Q. Scott Leonard. A. Scott Leonard. Maybe a couple. Q. Do you remember if those Zoom meetings or calls were saved on your calendar? A. No, I do not remember, or no. Q. Did you check prior to this deposition to see if they were on your calendar? A. Not any different for Scott versus one with Josh. Q. That's what I thought. I just didn't want to make any assumptions. About when were those Zoom meetings with Mr. Scott Leonard? A. As far as -- what do you mean about by when, like, in the evening, in the morning? Q. Oh, thank you for clarifying. I meant as far as what month. Early or late in the specific month. A. Probably more so August. Q. Do you have any recollection as to what part of August? The very beginning? Very end? A. No. Any -- like I said, I think there was a couple Zoom meetings with Scott. Q. Uh-huh. A. Those all would have fallen around that time frame. I didn't meet Scott through Zoom until around that time frame. Q. And what was the substance of --I'll go back. Who was -- who other than you and Scott Leonard were on those Zooms? A. They were the same as all the people listed, basically. Q. The larger group of people we talked about earlier; right? A. Yes. Q. And what all was discussed during those Zoom calls? A. More information about, like, technology, product knowledge, like product offerings maybe would be the better way to phrase that. And then, like, we talked earlier about that meeting with Cape Securities. Q. That was a meeting with Mr. Leonard and Cape Securities? A. Yes, we talked about that. Q. I was just making sure I'm clear. We talked about a lot of Zooms today and -A. Yeah. Q. -- probably even more this week. And so that first Zoom where you spoke to Mr. Leonard, you'll agree with me that you had not yet made up your mind that you were going to leave Primerica and join TerraWealth; correct? A. Correct. Q. And after you spoke to Mr. Leonard, you'll agree that you felt like that was the right decision for you to go to TerraWealth? A. Not necessarily at this -- at that time. Q. But it helped form your ultimate conclusion, though; right? A. I would say every meeting grew and grew to lead to that ultimate decision. Q. And so it grew and grew from the meetings with Mr. Mauk to the meetings with Mr. Leonard and others; correct? A. With Mr. Who, the first one? Q. Mr. Mauk. A. Mauk, yes. And there were some times where I said I don't know if TerraWealth is the right place for us. Q. And at the end of the day why did you believe TerraWealth was the right place for you? A. Because of -- like we discussed earlier, the technology, financial planning tools, even though it might not have been there, maybe what's coming down the road. Q. And the product offerings, too; right? A. Yep. Q. And the technology and the product offerings are things that Mr. Scott Leonard told you about on that Zoom call; correct? A. Yeah, yeah. A little bit. Q. If you could turn the page to request No. 4, please. I would ask you to please read that to yourself and let me know when you're ready to talk about it. A. Oh, yeah, I'm ready. Q. So I know that your attorney did provide some communications between you and clients. In addition to that, do you know if there are other communications that you have? A. In -Q. I'll -- I'll -- I'll take a step back because that's -- I'm not going to ask you to speculate. What did you do to search for responsive communications to request No. 4? A. Same as all the other: Texts, e-mails. Those kind of things. Phone and computer. Q. Did you ever --Let me step back and give a little context here. So you had Primerica clients and some of them are now your clients at TerraWealth; correct? A. Yes, some of them. Q. Did you ever e-mail any of them after your resignation to explain to them what they need to do to move over to TerraWealth? A. After we already verbally agreed and talked about it, yes. Q. Do you still have those e-mails? A. Yes. Q. Did you give those e-mails to your attorney? A. No. Q. You also via e-mail provided links to declarations for your clients, didn't you? A. Meaning the nonsolicittation form? Q. It's a declaration. Some of the declarations that you produced? A. Yeah. They were links and some were DocuSigns. Q. Who drafted the language that you used in those e-mails to your clients? A. I don't know. Q. It wasn't you, was it? A. In which e-mail? Q. I wish I could show you the e-mail because they weren't produced. So I don't know. But with that, you said that you had e-mails where you explained to your clients, who were your clients at Primerica, what they needed to do to move over to TerraWealth? A. Correct. Q. We're on the same page? A. Yeah. Q. Great. So you didn't draft the language in those e-mails, did you? A. I -- if I recall, and remember there was a template, and then I could adjust the template a little bit per conversation with the client or, like, because not every client has the same exact product and, per se. Q. Good point. And so you would work off a template and then just make minor adjustments or revisions based on that client? A. I wouldn't even say it was that. It was more of -- just, like, I did some in person with a client because they're elder, so sending them a link would be a little bit more complicated than, you know, getting together in person and printing off the document and having them sign it or whatever it may be, or help walk them through it. So, I guess, yeah. I -- I think that sums it up. Q. Where did you get the template that you used for those e-mails? A. I think from Terra. Q. From TerraWealth? A. I believe so. Q. Do you remember how you received that template from Terra? A. No. Q. Do you remember if it was an e-mail? A. Huh-uh. I don't remember. Q. Have you checked your TerraWealth e-mail or any e-mail address to see if that was transmitted to you via e-mail? A. I mean, not that specific template. Q. I think we are on the same page. I just want to make sure we're clear. You have not searched your e-mail accounts to specifically see if there is an e-mail transmitting the template language to you; correct? A. Correct. Q. As with everything, again, I instruct you not to delete any communications or e-mails. Did you have any other e-mails -- I will step back just so we're clear, we're not making assumptions. We're still talking about those clients who were clients at Primerica and are currently clients at TerraWealth. Other than the e-mails that included that template language, did you have any other e-mails with any of those clients? A. Not that I remember or can recall or... Q. You might, you just don't know sitting here? THE COURT REPORTER: Is that "yes" or a "no"? THE WITNESS: I don't remember now what the specific yes or no to -- would have been. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. In those e-mails we were just talking about with the template language would have happened after September 16th, 2022; correct? A. Say that question again. Q. We were talking about the e-mails that included the template language that were relating to how to transfer your clients over to TerraWealth; right? A. That's what we were talking about. Q. And you would have sent those e-mails after September 16th, 2022; correct? A. Yes. Yeah, obviously. Q. So prior to your resignation, did you communicate with any of your Primerica clients via e-mail? A. No, not that I remember during that time frame at all. Q. From January 1st, 2021, to September 16th, 2022, you never e-mailed your clients? A. Not any specifics that I remember as far as showing here's an e-mail that I have or anything. I don't remember communications. Q. Have you searched for communications between you and your clients from the date range of January 1st, 2021, to September 16th, 2022? A. Yes, and that's all deleted. Q. Those are all the e-mails that you deleted? A. Correct. Q. Because Mr. Mauk instructed you to? A. To make sure I didn't take client information with me. Q. You deleted them based off of your impression of what Mr. Mauk told you; correct? A. Correct. Q. Did you take notes during any of these Zoom meetings with Mr. Mauk or Mr. Scott Leonard? A. No, not really. No. Q. Did you take -- so no notes in your phone or handwritten notes? A. Not that I remember, no. I'm pretty bad at that part. Q. Did your wife take down any notes about these calls? A. Not that I remember. Q. Did your dad? A. I don't know. Q. Do you know if anyone else attending those calls took any notes? A. I don't. I don't know or remember or have -- I didn't necessarily remember talking about notes. Q. And that's fine. I just wanted to see if you knew. Did you ever look at any -- did you ever look at anything during your phone calls with clients after you resigned from Primerica? A. In what way? Q. Did you have a sheet of paper in front of you, something on your computer? A. Not that I remember anything specific or recall of anything like that. Q. You would agree with me that before you resigned, your dad knew the dollar amount of your assets under management at Primerica? A. I hope so. Q. And you know that he gave that information to TerraWealth, too; right? A. I -MR. ALONSO: Object. Calls for speculation. THE WITNESS: I don't know if he did or didn't. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Did you give it to TerraWealth? A. I did, yes. Q. How? A. Via Zoom, verbally over... Q. And when was that Zoom? A. I don't remember. Q. Who did you give that information to? A. I think it was maybe a Zoom call that we had done -- it was one of those leading up to it. Specifically, who would have been on from TerraWealth, might have been Scott and Josh, I don't remember, though, specifics. Q. Scott Leonard and Josh Mauk? A. Correct. Q. Why did you tell them the amount of your AUM? A. It had to do with understanding what potential products, whether it was going to Kate for the BD side, whether it was going to Fidelity for managed account side, if it was mutual funds going to managed accounts or mutual funds going to Cape. It was different AUMs, different things of that regard, as well as had to do with what promotional level. Q. Did you talk to them about the kind of the breakdown of the type of products you were currently offering to your clients at Primerica? A. They knew based off their history with Primerica. That was never really discussed. Q. Did they ask you about how much of your book was insurance-based versus other investments? A. I don't have any investments inside of insurance. Q. Perfect. And you gave them this information before you resigned; correct? A. Can I go back and redact my last statement? Q. I'm fine if you want to clarify, yeah. A. I was thinking insurance, like life insurance. I had -- I do have some annuities. Q. Okay. Thank you for clarifying. A. And, technically, that's a life insurance, right, product, so... Q. And so you gave them information regarding your assets under management before you resigned from Primerica; correct? A. Yeah. I do believe so, yes. Q. How did you know the dollar amount of your assets under management when you told them? A. Just ongoing and servicing my clients and seeing total reports. I mean, you log into Lifetime Management and it spits out your number right in front of you. So, I mean, you can't not service a client and not see it. And, I mean, for my entire career regularly I was looking at my reports, seeing where I'm at and... Q. And what kind of reports? A. Just total business reports or whatever it may have been. Q. Where would you get those total business reports? A. Like I said earlier, client DataNow was the new one -THE COURT REPORTER: Client? THE WITNESS: DataNow. -- was on Primerica Online and that was one that was a little bit more accurate than others. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. So you would access that information through Primerica Online? A. Correct. Q. And then you gave that information to, you believe, Mr. Scott Leonard and Mr. Josh Mauk? A. As far as the report or just the total dollar amount? Q. Total dollar amount. A. Yeah, total dollar amount. Q. And the dollar amount was from the report; right? A. Yeah. Give or take market fluctuations. Q. Other than verbally telling that information to Mr. Leonard and Mr. Mauk, did you give them any -- did you give them information about your AUM at any other time? A. Not that I remember. Q. Information about your downline? A. I -- none of -- I don't think any of my downlines have any assets under management. Q. Did you talk to Mr. Mauk or Mr. Scott Leonard about your downline at Primerica? A. Not -- in our calls they knew we had a larger maybe team would be to say that people were interested, wanted more information. I know we had people in our so-called downline. When I say "we," I am kind of referring to my family in that regards. And they had -people were interested in looking at other places, based on, you know, hearing things that had come out at that time. But, no, I don't know any specifics and I didn't have any downlines. I don't think I have any downlines that had a securities license, so... Q. Okay. Did you ever send yourself Primerica information like to a personal e-mail address? A. I --Rephrase or reask the question. Q. Did you ever access information through Primerica Online and e-mail it to one of your personal e-mail addresses? A. No. Q. Or save it to a flash drive? A. No. Not that I ever remember doing. That's false. Now that I remember. My mom and dad's upline had reached out to them in like April time frame that AUM was being lost, people were stealing AUM, so go online and download your reports, and my mom and dad didn't know how to do that. Q. Did you show them how? A. I helped them and get everybody's and saved it on the computer. And I think one of those ones was similar to what it looked like, I believe. Q. What exhibit is that, for the record? A. Plaintiff Exhibit 3. I think this is similar. It's not exact. There are so many different reports that were on -- you know, through my years of taking and working with Primerica, I know there's different reports, and... Q. So did you save those reports on your computer or your dad's? A. On my computer. Q. Are those reports still on your computer? A. No. Q. When was the last time they were on your computer? A. Maybe August. I deleted them. Q. When was the last time you looked at those reports? A. Maybe even Juneish. I didn't really ever needed to look at it. Q. Why did you look at them in June approximately? A. I never looked at the ones I downloaded. I honestly never looked at those, because I didn't need to. I can just log into Lifetime or, you know, client DataNow and see my existing client right then and there on Primerica online. Q. Got it. And then you deleted those reports, is it in August of 2022? A. That would be my best guess. Maybe even earlier than that, knowing that we can't take client information with us, so I don't want that. I didn't want that. Q. So who told y'all that AUM was disappearing? A. Bill and Donna Travis, which is my mom's and dad's -- was my mom and dad's upline at Primerica. Q. Do you know Bill and Donna? A. Yes. Q. How long have you known them? A. Since I was a little boy. Q. When is the last time you talked to them? A. A long while. I mean, a year. Maybe longer. Q. So your team that came over -- I'm not trying to trick you here. The group, Thompson group that came over with the Thompsons and the Doucettes, do you know if any of people from that group have spoken to Bill and Donna Travis since making the move to TerraWealth? A. I do not, no. Q. Have y'all talked about Bill and Donna Travis? A. No, not that I remember. Q. If there were conversations, you just weren't a part of them? A. Yeah. The only thing I remember speaking about Bill and Donna is just that -- I mean, they were kind of -- like, I always joked they're my Primerica grandparents. So it was more just a heartfelt -- we can't communicate with them because we don't want anything. And so we just haven't talked to them and that hurts my heart very much. Because they -- they were my Primerica grandparents, and it very much hurts. Q. Do you know how they're doing financially right now? A. I have no idea. I know -- I mean, since I've known them since I was a little kid they've done very well in the business of Primerica. They invested very well. I'm sure they're very well off. Q. But you do know that the Thompsons and the Doucettes going to TerraWealth did hurt them financially? A. Not the Doucettes. Q. The -- the Thompsons? A. Yes. And that does hurt and it hurts more so about the relationship that we have with them. Q. Used to have? A. Yeah. Q. Whose idea was it for Mr. Alonso to represent you? A. I think it was a referral from TerraWealth. Q. Why do you think that? A. I don't know. Q. When did you first learn that Mr. Alonso was potentially a referral from TerraWealth? A. I don't -- I don't know. Q. When's the first time you heard Mr. Alonso's name, that you remember? A. I -- may be around Labor Dayish. Q. Who told you -- who brought up his name? A. I don't remember. Q. What was your impression of why his name was even being brought up? A. That we were looking for an attorney to make sure -- we knew what was the correct legal way to protect us, to protect our clients, to make a smooth transition to leave one financial firm to another financial firm. Q. I know you said it. Was this August? A. What was August? Q. The first time his name came up. A. Maybe late August. Maybe Labor Day. Q. Okay. That is right. That's what you said. A. I don't -- yeah. Q. Did you ever get any texts or e-mails about whether you were going to retain Mr. Alonso or that you needed to get an attorney? A. No, not that I remember. Q. It was all just verbal communications? A. That's the best -- my ability of remembering, yeah. Q. Did you -- did you personally consider hiring any other attorneys? A. No. MR. TURMAN: I promise this not a knock on you, Mr. Alonso. I'm just trying to get the questions here. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Why not? A. Because I don't know any good attorneys that help financial firms go to another financial firm. Q. Is it fair to say that if you did have communications in August about that subject matter and they were written communications, they would have already been deleted by now? A. Yes. MR. TURMAN: We will make this portion confidential, please. (Start of confidential testimony.) (End of confidential testimony.) BY MR. TURMAN: Q. We talked a lot about Zoom meetings earlier. I think one to two a month per month with Mr. Mauk and then also one or two, approximately, with Mr. Scott Leonard; right? To your knowledge, were any of those recordings or any of those Zoom meetings recorded? A. I think early on Josh made sure he recorded the Zooms to make sure that -- to show we were asking questions and he was doing demonstrations. He wasn't trying to recruit and solicit us. Q. Have you seen those recordings? A. No. I was there. Q. How long was that recording approximately? A. I have no idea. Q. And it could have been multiple ones. I think you said recordings? A. Uh-huh. Q. And did Josh Mauk tell you why he was recording those Zoom meetings? A. I think all I remember was just saying to protect us or protect you guys. Q. And those were his words? A. No, they were not his words. That's my summary of what I remember. Q. I am glad we're being clear here. Did he tell you why he was recording it? A. Not that I remember. I'm -- I speculated to show that we're not recruiting. Q. Gotcha. MR. TURMAN: We can go off the record for a confidential and some of that won't be confidential. We will talk about it at the break. I forgot again to let you know. Give me just a moment. I can shuffle through these papers and hopefully get closer to sending you on your way for the day. THE WITNESS: You're good. All I have is military training. MR. ALONSO: That's all right. Let him ask. MR. TURMAN: You're safe. I'm not going to ask you about your military training. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. Whose idea was it for everyone that we've discussed today to resign on September 16th, 2022? A. I don't know. Q. Did someone tell you that was the day that you would be resigning on? A. I don't remember. Q. Was it your decision? A. I mean, yes. Q. Why did you pick September 16th? A. I believe that was per our conversation with my attorney. Q. Did anyone, other than your attorney, guide you in making that determination of what day you should resign on? A. Not that I remember. Q. Were you instructed a particular time of day to resign? A. No. Q. You could have resigned at midnight, if you wanted? A. I think so. Q. Why did you resign at the time you did? A. I was making sure at that point I had received all my documents -- any additional documents I had from clients, I needed to make sure I got it and I mailed it to Primerica that morning. Q. So you mailed the box before you sent your resignation? A. Yes. Q. Do you ever access videos on SalesTeamPro? A. I have since I resigned. Q. Yeah. Since you resigned from Primerica and joined TerraWealth? A. Yes. Q. And you've actually -- you're on some of those videos; right? A. I haven't watched any recordings of it, but I have spoke on one training about -- I think it was the topic was my 4D financial planning process. Q. Have you -- so you've spoken on one but you've watched multiple videos on SalesTeamPro; right? A. I've watched a couple. Q. Which ones? A. Overlay investment strategies with Bison. I don't know exactly who, and Roy was doing a training with them. And then I've watched a couple live videos and trainings that they've done but not in any recordings. And then I've maybe referenced one or two of those, but I actually haven't had time to sit down and just watch anything. Q. Does anybody else help you do your job? Like, do you have any other employees or assistants? A. No. I don't have any employees. Q. It would be great; right? A. I'm trying to teach my wife. Q. Have you input client information in SalesTeamPro? A. Since resigning? Q. At any time. A. Yes. I used -- as I said before, I used SalesTeamPro in November of 2021 for a few months, and I had started to input information, clients' names, e-mails. Q. Did you -A. And then since we resigned, because they all got deleted, and then the new SalesTeamPro had started. I have a couple in there. Q. What information all got deleted? A. The -- it was the names, phone numbers, e-mails. That kind of information of clients. Q. When? A. That was back in, like, March when SalesTeamPro and Peter Schneider and all them said that that's going to be nonexistent anymore. You can't use SalesTeamPro and all that. Q. How do you know all that information was deleted? A. I downloaded my information and deleted it. Q. When did you do that? A. In March. Q. And what did you do with the information you downloaded? A. I -- I think I tried to upload it into Primerica's new CRM system because I was still actively as a financial advisor at Primerica, but I -- I don't remember using it or not using it. It just was -- and beta testing is I think what they kept referring to, but then that would have been completely deleted from my computer. Q. I think you said this earlier. I just want to confirm. When did you know or you had the impression that TerraWealth was going to cover legal fees for this; right? A. I had heard that, I think, on one of the Zoom calls. Q. Who told you that? A. I don't remember. Q. And I'm not asking if it's your attorney who told you that. Was it somebody affiliated with TerraWealth who told you that? A. I don't remember. Q. Do you have any impression as to whether -- was there ever any discussion about if anyone leaving Primerica to join TerraWealth gets in trouble and gets a judgment against them, that TerraWealth is going to cover the bill? A. I did not -- I don't know. I have not heard that terminology. Q. So I think we were talking about the info you pulled from SalesTeamPro and you said you were not able to put it into Primerica's CRM; correct? A. I think I had tried. I don't remember. I might have done a couple of manually and then just kind of was like this is... Primerica kept saying in trainings that it's going to get better and better and better and wait until convention and more is going to be rolling out. So I was kind of waiting until a little bit more was better. And then some clients automatically fed in there, because, obviously, Primerica has all that information internally. MR. TURMAN: And I'll object as nonresponsive and we will look at the transcript later on that. BY MR. TURMAN: Q. What did you do then with the information that you pulled out of SalesTeamPro? A. I had it on my computer. Q. Until when? A. Maybe Julyish and then I deleted it. Q. Was that after the conversation with Josh Mauk? A. Maybe. I might have even deleted that sooner. Q. Okay.
