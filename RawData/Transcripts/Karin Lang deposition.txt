Q Great. Good morning, Ms. Lang. My nameis Michael Bekesha. I'm an attorney for Judicial Watch, and I'm here to ask you some questions about one of Judicial Watch's Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the State Department, specifically questions surrounding the creation, purpose, and use of the Clintonemail.com system by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin to conduct official business. Before we begin, could you please state and spell your full name, for the record. A Karin Melka Lang. First name Karin, K-A-R-I-N; middle name Melka, M-E-L-K-A; last name Lang, L-A-N-G. Q Thank you. And I'd also like to go over a few ground rules. Your counsel may have already talked to you about them, but they'll help the deposition go more smoothly. If you don't hear one of my questions or don't understand one of my questions, please let me know, I'll be happy to either rephrase or repeat the question. Also, it's important that you respond out loud. If you shake your head or make any hand gestures, the court reporter isn't going to be able to record those sorts of things. Finally, it's important that you wait until I'm done asking questions to answer questions. And if counsel has any objections, to wait until counsel is done with her objections. That way the court reporter can easily record what everybody is saying. With that, what's your current job title at the State Department? A I'm the director of the Executive Secretariat staff. Q And how long have you been in that position? A Since July of 2015. Q Okay. And prior to July of 2015, what was your immediate position, immediate past position at the State Department? A I was director of American Citizen Services at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico. Q And what -- what was the time period for that? A July 2013 -- August 2013 to July 2015. Q Okay. And I don't want to go too far back in your employment history at the State Department, but just the years from 2009 to, I guess, 2013. Did you have one position or several positions at the State Department? A In 2009 I was chief of immigrant visas at the U.S. Consulate in Quanzhou, China. I left that position in 2010. I then spent a year at the National Defense University. And in July 2011 I became Deputy Director of the Office of Japanese Affairs at the Department of State, a position I held until July 2013 when I went to Mexico. Q Okay. Thank you. In any of those positions between 2009 and two thousand -- I guess until 2015, did you have any duties or responsibilities related to processing of FOIA requests? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope of the 30(b)(6) deposition notice. And I'll instruct the witness not to answer as it's beyond the scope of authorized discovery. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. Q Starting -- when you started your job in July of 2015 at the Executive Secretariat staff --I guess let's -- before I ask you about your specific job duties, what is the general role of the Executive Secretariat staff? A The Executive Secretariat or the Executive Secretariat staff? Q The Executive Secretariat staff. A The Executive Secretariat staff coordinates preparation and reviews all briefing materials, memoranda, official correspondence for the Secretary, the Deputy Secretaries, and the Under Secretaries of State. The Executive Secretariat staff ensures proper records management for the Secretary and these other department principals, retrieval of archived documents for the Secretary and other -and these other senior principals. And the Executive Secretariat staff also advances the Secretary's international travel and staffs his mobile office overseas. Q Okay. Thank you. Today we are going to focus on -specifically on the FOIA obligations, or the FOIA responsibilities of the Executive Secretariat staff. When you started that position in July 15, what specific FOIA training did you have? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Again, beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition. I'll instruct the witness not to answer as it's beyond the scope of authorized discovery. Q Could you talk specific -- generally about what your responsibilities are when it comes to FOIA? MS. WOLVERTON: Same objection, and same instruction not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. Q How large is the Office of Secretariat staff? How long -- how large is the office or the staff of the Executive Secretariat staff? A It is an office of 47 full-time equivalent positions. Q And how many of those employees work specifically on FOIA-related issues? A Full time on FOIA-related issues? Q I guess we could break it up in full time or part time. A The office is divided into two divisions, the Advance and Staffing Division and the Correspondence and Records Division. The FOIA responsibilities fall into the Correspondence and Records Division. The deputy director of that division is primarily responsible for FOIA. There's also a management analyst in that division who searches for FOIA, is responsible for FOIA. And part-time a third employee assists with FOIA searches. As the director of the office, part of my duties involve processing FOIA requests. Q Okay. Thank you. And has the Office of the Executive Secretariat staff always been responsible for the processing of FOIA pros -- FOIA requests with respect to the Office of the Secretary? A Prior to January 2013, the Office of Correspondence and Records within the Executive Secretariat had that responsibility. It was merged with the Secretariat staff in January of 2013. Q Okay. And between -- prior to January 13, from January -- say January 2009 to January 13, who was the director of the Correspondence and Records office? A The director of that office was Clarence Finney. Q Okay. And now you said there's a Deputy Director for the -- what is now the Correspondence and Records Division. Who is the Deputy Director for that? A It is still Clarence Finney. Q Okay. Did any of his responsibilities change with the merger? A No. Q Okay. And does Mr. Finney directly report to you now? Is that -A Yes. Q And before that who did he report to? Before the merger, I'm sorry. Before the merger, who did Mr. Finney report to? A Before the merger, as an office director, Mr. Finney reported to a Deputy Executive Secretary. Q Between 2009 and 2013, who was the Deputy Executive Secretary that Mr. Finney reported to? A There was -- there were several. In chronological order, starting with January 21st, 09, Mr. Finney's supervisor, the Deputy Executive Secretary, was Paul Wohlers. Q Could you spell his last name, please? A I believe it's W-O-H-L-E-R-S. Q Thank you. A Starting in mid two thousand -- 2009, it was Kin Moy. Q Could you spell that name for us, please? A K-I-N, M-O-Y. Q Okay. And then next? A Starting in mid 2011, it was Pamela Quanrud. Q Okay. And after Ms. Quanrud? A Then I believe it was Julieta Noyes. Q Could you spell that name, please? A I believe it's J-U-L-I-E-T-A, N-O-Y-E-S. Q Okay. And when did she -A In the second half of 2013. Q Okay. So after -- after her chronologically, Mr. Finney started reporting then to the Director -- or, sorry, to the -- to your current position, the Director of the Executive Secretariat? A When -- at the time of the merger, Mr. Finney reported to -- then began to report to the director of the combined office, the Director of the Executive Secretariat staff. Q Okay. And that merger took place, is there a specific date in January of 2013? A It was effective January 21st, 2013. Q Okay. And who was the Director of the Executive Secretariat staff at that time? A Paul Horowitz. Q Could you spell that last name, please? A H-O-R-O-W-I-T-Z. Q Thank you. Now that we have some of the basic information out of the way, I'm just going to lay out the questions I have today and where we're going to be going so everybody knows. You know, today we're going to discuss three specific topics. First I want to discuss the processing of the FOIA request in this case. Second I want to discuss generally the processing of FOIA requests for e-mails of Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin during Mrs. Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. And then third and finally, I want to discuss generally the processing of FOIA requests for e-mails of Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin subsequent to Mrs. Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. So we're going to -- I'll start off talking about the FOIA request at issue in this case. First I'm just going to ask you to confirm a couple of dates, and then we'll go back and have a -- more of a discussion about those. With -- related to the FOIA request at issue at this date, is it correct that Judicial Watch sent the FOIA request on May 21st, 2013? MS. WOLVERTON: Just to clarify, you mean the FOIA request at issue in this case? I think you said "at this date." MR. BEKESHA: I'm sorry, at this case -in this case. A Yes. Q And the State Department acknowledged and assigned a case number on June 5th, 2013? A Yes. Q And the case number that was assigned is F-2013-08812? A Yes. Q Judicial Watch filed a complaint in federal court on September 10, 2013. Is that correct? A Yes. Q Is it correct that the State Department was served on September 15, 2013? A I understood the State Department was served on September 17, 2013. Q Okay. Thank you. Is it correct that by letter dated February 12th, 2014, in part the State Department stated that it had completed searches of the following Department of State record systems: The Central Foreign Policy records, the Bureau of Human Resources, the Office of the Executive Secretariat, and the Office of the Legal Advisor? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Lack of foundation. Assumes facts not in evidence. It seems that you're referring to a document. Perhaps you could introduce the document and show it to the witness so she could verify what you're representing. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. This can be marked as Exhibit 1. (Deposition Exhibit 1 marked for identification and is attached to the transcript.) Q Have you had time to review the document? A Yes. Q Thank you. Is this a -- is what has been marked as Exhibit 1 a February 12, 2014, letter from the Department of State to Judicial Watch, advising Judicial Watch that it had completed -- the State Department had completed searches within its office in response to its FOIA request? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The document speaks for itself. Q You may answer the question. A Yes. Q All right. Thank you. We're now going to talk -- take a step back and talk about the processing of the FOIA request between each of those -- within those dates that we just identified. Between May 21st, 2013, and June 5th, 13, did the State Department receive the FOIA requests from Judicial Watch? A I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question? Q Sure. Between May 21st, 2013, when the FOIA request was sent, and June 5th, 2013, when did the State Department -- I'll change the question a little -- when did the State Department receive the FOIA request? A I believe it was May 21st. Q Okay. And who -- who was it received by? A It was received by the Office of Information Programs and Services within the Bureau of Administration, which has responsibility for FOIA processing within the Department of State. Q Who within that office received the FOIA request? A Within the Office of Information Programs and Services, which I'll refer to as IPS, by its initials, the office of -- the division is the Requester Liaison Division, and the branch that does initial processing of FOIA requests is the Requester Communications Branch. It was received by the Requester Communications Branch. Q Is there a specific employee that received the FOIA request within that branch? A No. Q Okay. After IPS received the FOIA request, what happened next? A The Requester Communication Branch receives all incoming FOIA requests, reviews them to ensure that they're complete, and assigns -- scans them into the case processing system, assigns them a case tracking number, and then passes them from data entry to an initial processing officer for review. Q And on what date was this FOIA request transferred to the case processing -- I'm sorry, the case processing -- how did you describe that employee? I'm sorry. A The initial processing officer. Q Initial processing officer. When -- when was it transferred to the initial processing officer? A It's -- it's not clear. It's clear that the initial processing officer reviewed it on June th. Q And who was that initial processing officer? A A former employee of the Department of State named Holly Woodson. Q Okay. And what happened next? A The initial processing officer reviews a FOIA request to ensure that it -- that it's a proper request; in other words, it meets -- it is a request for records that are reasonably likely to be in the State Department's possession, that the request is clear enough to be actionable, that it meets the other requirements as noted on our website. And that -- that officer then prepares the draft response letter, the acknowledgment of receipt letter to the -- to the requester, which indicates things like the request for fee waiver, expedited processing, those kinds of questions. That officer prepares that -- that requester letter, which is reviewed by a team leader for accuracy and then approved. Q And who was the team leader that reviewed and approved the FOIA request introduced -- sorry, the document introduced as Exhibit 1? A I'm sorry. I don't have that information. Q Do you know who would have that information? A We can consult with IPS. Q What happened next? A The -- once the request is approved, again the initial case processing officer makes sure that that response is scanned into the case file, and then passes it to the mail room to mail to the requester. Q Okay. What happens next? A The case processing officer makes a determination. The -- the Requester Liaison Division is now finished with this FOIA case, and typically finished with the FOIA case except for perhaps case status inquiries that might come in later. At this point the Requester Liaison Division transfers the case to the Compliance and Research Division of IPS. And within the Compliance and Research Division, the initial case processing officer will send it to one of three branches. Q Okay. When was it -- when was this specific FOIA request transferred to the Compliance and Research Division? A On June 10th. Q Okay. And after it was transferred on June 10th, what happened next? A In -- in the branch that it was assigned to, FOIA requests typically come in, are reviewed by the branch chief and assigned to one of the case analysts within that branch. The case -- this case -- I'm sorry. I misspoke. Holly Woodson was the case analyst that was assigned in compliance and research. Q Okay. Do you recall the name of the employee that you -- was that the management analyst position? I forget how you identified her before, but do you recall -A The initial processing officer, I'm sorry, we'll have to get that information from IPS. Q Okay. Thank you. So it was -- on June 10th it was assigned to the case analyst. What branch? You said there were potentially three branches. What branch was that case analyst in? A A branch known as MPD, which is Management and Public Diplomacy. Q And what are the other two branches? A The branches are divided up regionally and functionally. The other two branches are EAN and WHA. Q What do they stand for? A WHA stands for Western Hemisphere Affairs. And EAN stands for East Asia -- I believe it is East Asia, Africa, and Near East. Q Okay. And so this specific FOIA request was transferred to the -A We have a -- I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt. Q Oh, not a problem. A We actually have an organization chart. And I don't know if ... Q Thank you. MR. BEKESHA: Are these records being produced today or being used for the witness's -- to refresh her recollection or -MS. WOLVERTON: Yes. Yeah. She's using them to refresh her recollection. We're happy to give you a copy if you'd like. MR. BEKESHA: That would be great. I guess we could introduce it as Exhibit 2. MS. WOLVERTON: Okay. MR. BEKESHA: Do we want to introduce the whole -- why don't we take a minute and go off the record. MS. WOLVERTON: Sure. VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are going off the record. The time is 9:33. (A recess was taken.) (Deposition Exhibit 2 marked for identification and is attached to the transcript.) VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are back on the record. The time is 9:34. BY MR. BEKESHA: Q Thank you. And for the record, we have marked the binder as Exhibit 2. Ms. Lang, just for our reference, which tab were you just referring to? A 7C. Q And could you just identify what -- what Tab 7C is, what are we looking at? A Tab 7C is an organization chart of the Office of Information Programs and Services. Q Thank you. So once the FOIA request was assigned to the case analyst within the -- I forgot the initial. A Management and Public Diplomacy branch. Q Thank you. Within that branch, what happened next? A When a case analyst receives a FOIA request, the case analyst analyzes the request to determine which bureaus and offices or which records in the department's possession should be searched that would be reasonably likely to contain responsive records. Q Okay. And when did that -- and was a determination made in this case where -- where -where it should be transferred to next, what -- what departments and bureaus may have potentially responsive records? A The case analyst made a determination that the Bureau of Human Resources would be the -- would be the bureau that would be likely to have responsive records. She also made a determination that the Central Foreign Policy files, which are controlled by IPS, maintained within IPS, should be searched. Q And when was that determination made? A The tasking to the Bureau of Human Resources was sent on June 17, 2003 -- 2013. Q Excuse me. And what about the tasking for the Central -- Central Foreign Policy records? A That's not a tasking; that's a search that the IPS analyst does him or herself. Q Oh, okay. Thank you. A Because it's internal to IPS. Q Okay. And when was a search conducted of the Central Foreign Policy records system? A It's not clear that a search was conducted prior to the case going into litigation. Q Okay. Was any other departments or bureaus tasked at that time to conduct searches for potentially responsive records? A No. Q Okay. When was the Office of the Executive Secretariat determined to potentially have responsive records? A After the case went into litigation. Q Do you have a specific date as to when that happened? A The case was transferred -- now, if you look at the org chart. Q Okay. A When a case becomes the subject of litigation under the FOIA, it is transferred from the Statutory Compliance and Research Division, to the Programs and Policies Division. Within the Programs and Policies Division, there is a branch called Litigations and Appeals. So after the State Department was served, noticed that the case had entered litigation, the case was transferred to the Litigations and Appeals branch. That transfer was September 23rd. Q Okay. And who was assigned? Was a individual assigned within the programs and policies -- sorry, within the Litigation and Appeals branch to the specific FOIA request? A Yes. Q Who was that person? A Two case analysts were assigned. Similar to the other -- the Compliance and Research Division, when a case comes into the Litigation and Appeals, it will be assigned to one case analyst. In this case it was assigned to two case analysts, Saffie Goushe and Robert McNeary. Q Could you please spell both of those names, to the best you can. A I can try. Saffie is I believe S-A-F-F-I-E, G -- last name G-O-U-S-H-E. Q Okay. And the other -- the other individual? A Robert, R-O-B-E-R-T, M-C-N-E-A-R-Y. Q And why were -- why was two case analysts assigned to this specific FOIA request? A It's not clear from the record, but it's likely because one was training the other. Q Which one was the trainee? A Saffie Goushe was the more experienced litigation analyst. Q Okay. Thank you. Besides having the file transferred to the Litigation and Appeals branch upon the case -- the lawsuit being filed, what else does the department do once a case has been -- once litigation has commenced? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague and -vague. Q You may answer the question. A When a case enters litigation, the Office of the Legal Advisor becomes involved in consulting with the Litigation and Appeals branch of IPS. Q Do you know if a litigation hold or similar notice is created or provided to anyone within the department? A Yes. When a case enters litigation, the Litigation and Appeals branch takes a look at the status of case processing at that -- at that time that it enters litigation and reviews what the status is, takes appropriate steps depending on the status of searches in the case. Q Okay. So when the Litigation and Appeals branch received this FOIA request, what did it do? What were the next steps? A It reviewed the pending searches. No response had been received from the Bureau of Human Resources at that point. And it determined that additional -- additional locations within the department should be tasked to conduct searches. Q And what were those additional locations? A The additional locations were the Office of the Executive Secretariat and the Office of the Legal Advisor. Q Okay. And when was that determination made? A The taskings were sent out to those two additional offices on the first of October. Q And how are taskings sent out; what is the process? A Taskings -- are you familiar with the Form DS-1748? Q I am not. A Okay. The DS-1748 is a State Department form that is used for tasking FOIA searches. It is -- it is filled out by the analyst in IPS and typically e-mailed to the relevant offices or bureaus that are -- that are to conduct searches. The form DS-1748 itself contains all the basic information about the case and instructions for conducting the search. It also has space for the searchers to fill in the information about who conducted the search, when the search was conducted, which files were searched. Q And who sent -- in this specific case, was a tasking e-mail sent to the various departments? A Yes. Q When were those tasking e-mails sent? A October 1st. Q They were all sent on the same day? A Yes. Q Thank you. And who sent the tasking e-mails? A It was either Robert McNeary or Saffie Goushe. Q Okay. Do you know which one of the two of them decided that additional offices should be tasked? A No. Q Okay. With respect to the Office of the Executive Secretariat, who -- where was that e-mail sent? Where was the tasking e-mail sent? A It was sent to Clarence Finney, the Director of the Office of Correspondence and Records. Correction. At that point it was the Division of Correspondence and Records within the Executive Secretariat staff. Q Okay. Do you know when he received that e-mail, when he opened the e-mail and read it? A October 1st. Q Okay. So what happened next? What did Mr. Finney do once he received on October 1st the task -- the tasking e-mail? A Mr. Finney assigned -- when -- when a FOIA request is received from IPS to the Executive Secretariat to the Correspondence and Records Division, typically the Deputy Director, Clarence Finney, reviews the tasking to determine what searches should be conducted, where they should be conducted, based on the content of the request itself. Q Okay. And did that happen in this case? A Yes. Q So what did -- what did Mr. Finney decide after reviewing the tasking e-mail? A He decided that the management analyst within Correspondence and Records should conduct a search. Q And how did he -- did he then notify the management analyst of this determination? A Yes. Q Who was that management analyst? A Jonathon Wasser. Q And how did he notify Mr. Wasser of his determination? A Typically because there's an e-mail that has come from IPS, the Deputy Director forwards the e-mail to the management analyst because it contains the attachment that is the DS-1748 form I referred to earlier. Q Thank you. Do you know when Mr. Finney forwarded that e-mail to Mr. Wasser? A I don't know the exact date. Q Do you have roughly -- do you have an approximate date or roughly the time period that that happened? A October 2013. Q Okay. Do you know if Mr. Finney -what -- did Mr. Finney write anything additional besides, or did he just forward the e-mail along to Mr. Wasser? A Just -- taskers are really very self-explanatory. As I said, they -- they contain all the information necessary to conduct the search. Q Okay. So in this tasker, what offices within the Office of the Executive Secretary were to be searched? Did the tasker identify specific individuals or divisions within the general Office of the Executive Secretariat? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Compound. Q You may answer the question. A The DS-1748 that comes from IPS does not go into that level of detail. The IPS sends a search tasker to an office or a bureau. Within that office or bureau, the bureau coordinator determines which components should conduct searches. Q Okay. So is that bureau coordinator, would that have been Mr. Wasser? A No. The bureau coordinator is Mr. Finney. Q Okay. So Mr. Finney determined which offices or divisions should be searched? A Yes. Q Okay. What offices or divisions did Mr. Finney in this case determine needed to be searched? A Mr. Finney determined that within the Executive Secretariat staff, certain databases should be searched. That was what was assigned to Jonathon Wasser. Additionally, he determined that the Office of the Executive Director within the Executive Secretariat should conduct a search. Q Okay. And how did he inform Mr. Wasser which databases in the Office of the Executive Director should be searched? A I don't know that he informed him specifically in this case which databases to search. But Mr. Wasser, as an experienced management analyst, was familiar with the databases that were under the control of Correspondence and Records and available to search. Q Okay. So Mr. Wasser received this task in October of 2013. What did he do once he received that task? A He conducted searches in November of 2013. Q And what searches did he conduct? A He searched the STARS database, the CARS database, the STEPS database. Q Could you -- let's just talk about each of those very briefly. What does STARS stand for? A STARS stands for Secretariat tracking and retrieval system. Q And what types of records are within the STARS database? A At the time STARS was the official repository for all memoranda and records of the Office of the Secretary, Deputy Secretaries, and Under Secretaries, including briefing material, information memos, action memos, any kind of meeting preparatory information or official decisions, official correspondence of the Secretary and other department principals. It was at the time the main repository of information coming from the Office of the Secretary and of information going to the Office of the Secretary. Q Did the STARS database include e-mails of the Secretary or other principals? A The STARS database was not an e-mail archiving system. However, STARS had the capacity to store a variety of types of media, including e-mails. And there were some e-mails, there are some e-mails stored in STARS. Q Generally how do the e-mails make their way into STARS? A The e-mails that made their way into STARS did not do so electronically automatically. They mostly made their way into STARS through what we call out-boxing. Q What -- what is that? A Out-boxing, any -- any material that is seen by the Secretary and ends up in his or her outbox is generally bundled up by support staff and passed to Correspondence and Records, where it's recorded. Material that has been seen by the Secretary or material that has handwritten notes, for example, by the Secretary. Q How would an e-mail end -- make its way to the outbox? Is that just a printing type? A Printing and filing. Q Okay. A Printing. Q So somebody would have to print and then file it or place it in the outbox for it to then make its way into STARS? A Correct. Q Okay. You said STEPS was also searched. What does STEPS stands -- stand for? A STEPS stood for state telegram electronic processing system. This is a legacy system that is no longer used. Q And what types of records was within STEPS? A STEPS contained telegrams, official cable -- cable telegrams that were sent to or from the department between the department and its -- and its overseas posts. Q Okay. And were e-mails part of that system? A No. Q Okay. And you mentioned CARS. What does CARS stand for? A CARS stands for cable archiving and retrieval system. Similar to STEPS, it was a legacy system for capturing cable traffic between the department and posts. Q So CARS also wouldn't include e-mails -A No. Q -- is that correct? Okay. Were top -- were the top-secret files searched in response to this FOIA request? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Lack of foundation, and vague. Q You may answer the question. A I don't believe so. Q Okay. Could you just identify -- taking a step back. The top secret -- top-secret files, is that another database within the Office of the Executive Secretariat? A No. Those are hard-copy files. Q Okay. And where are those -- who are those kept by? A By the Office of Correspondence and Records. Q Okay. Thank you. Was the Everest -- is Everest another records-management or records-archiving system? A Everest is the successor to STARS, yes. Q Do you know when Everest started, when it took over for STARS? A STARS ceased accepting new entries January st, 2015. Q Is SMART another records system? A Yes. Q Okay. What does SMART stand for? A I believe it stands for state messaging archival retrieval tracking? I'm sorry, I don't know exactly what the acronym stands for. Q If I say it's state messaging and archive retrieval tool set, does that sound right? A It sounds like I was pretty close. Q Yes. I thought I would help you out there. Could you just talk briefly what types of records or what the SMART system is? A SMART took the place of all these legacy systems for the archiving of cable traffic between the department and overseas posts. So that's why I said we would no longer search the CARS or STEPS database. Because all that information would be in the Central Foreign Policy files through SMART. Q Okay. And when did -- when did SMART take effect? A I'm sorry. And SMART is also a -- a -- a tool for creating record e-mails. Q What do you mean by that? A SMART has a function that allows a sender to -- to make an e-mail, a record e-mail, that puts it in the central searchable archive. Q Okay. What -- and how is that process done? A It's done very similar to creating a cable. It's done at a user's desktop. Q Okay. So the user has to take a couple steps. Is it a couple of steps, is it clicking a button? I'm just trying to get a sense of what action is required to make it part of the SMART system. A It's a series of essentially clicks and check boxes and drop-down menus. Q Okay. And when did the SMART system take effect? A I believe SMART was introduced in the department in 2009, but it was -- SMART was rolled out over a period of years. Q Okay. What -A If you want more details on that, I will take that back and get back to you. Q Who would -- who would have the answers? Who would be best knowledgeable about the SMART system and the rollout? A The Bureau of Information Resource and Management, IRM. Q Okay. When -- you said it generally was -- the rollout started in January of 2009. When was it -- was it rolled out at that time for the Office of the Secretary? MS. WOLVERTON: At this point I'm going to object to this line of question as straying fairly far beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic and on that basis instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. Q You said the e-mails would have -- could be part of the SMART system. Is that correct? A Yes. E-mails could be part of the SMART system. Q Okay. Were e-mails of Mrs. Clinton, would those have been placed within the SMART system? A The Executive Secretariat is -- has its own information management IT shop, which is known by the acronym S/ES-IRM. And S/ES-IRM does not use the SMART system. Q Okay. So Mrs. Clinton's e-mails would not have been part of the SMART system. Is that correct? A Any -- any office supported by S/ES-IRM is not part of the SMART e-mail system. That includes the Office of the Secretary, the two deputy secretaries, and the under secretaries. Q Okay. Thank you. Is RIMS another database records management system? A That is the database that is searched by IPS. Q Okay. And what does RIMS stand for? A I think it's record information management system. I can confirm that to you. Q Okay. Thank you. Going back to the searches that were -strike that. So Mr. Wasser, you said he conducted searches of STARS, STEPS, and CARS, in November of 13. Is that correct? A Yes. Q Did he search any other databases? A No. Q Did he search anywhere else for records responsive to this FOIA request? A No. Q Did he instruct anybody else to search for records responsive to this FOIA request? A No. Q Okay. Were individual employees within the office -- were records within the office -strike that. Excuse me. Were records searched for -- records of individual employees within the Office of the Secretary, were their records searched in response to this FOIA request? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. Q Was Mrs. Clinton's e-mail searched in response to this FOIA request at that time, in November 2013? A In November 2013, former Secretary Clinton's e-mails were not in the possession or control of the State Department so could not have been searched in response to a FOIA request. Q Why were they not in the possession and control of the State Department? A Secretary Clinton turned over her e-mails to the State Department in December of 2014. Q Was there a determination made at any point that Mrs. Clinton's e-mail records were not within the custody and control of the State Department? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. Q When reviewing -- when responding to FOIA -- when responding to this FOIA request, was a determination made that Mrs. Clinton's e-mails were not subject -- were not part of the custody and control of the State Department? A Can you clarify the time frame that you're speaking about? Q Sure. The time frame would be between the FOIA request being sent in May 21st, 2013, and the date of the response, February 12th, 2014. Was a determination made during that time period, when responding to this FOIA request, that Mrs. Clinton's e-mails were not under the custody and control of the State Department? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) topic. I'll direct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: And this goes to the search, the FOIA search that was conducted of Mrs. Clinton's e-mails. It's definitely within the scope of the 30(b)(6). MS. WOLVERTON: Can you repeat the question? MR. BEKESHA: Sure. BY MR. BEKESHA: Q When conducting a search for records responsive to Mrs. -- responsive to the FOIA request at issue in this case between May 21st, 2013, and February 12th, 2014, was a determination made that Mrs. Clinton's e-mails were not under the custody and control of the State Department and, therefore, did not have to be searched in response to this FOIA request? MS. WOLVERTON: You may answer. A No. Q Was a FOIA -- was that determination made previous to this time period and relied upon when responding to the FOIA request at issue in this case during that time period I just identified? A No. Q So why was it the State Department's position to not search Mrs. Clinton's e-mails because they were -- the State Department thought they were outside the custody and control of it? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Asked and answered. Q You may answer the -MS. WOLVERTON: And mischaracterizing former testimony. Q You may answer the question. A No one engaged in this FOIA search had awareness of that source of potentially responsive documents during the time period of this FOIA search. The time period that you list between May st, 2013, and February 2nd, 2014, no one engaged in this FOIA search had the awareness of that source of potentially responsive documents. Q So the reason -- I guess go back because I'm not sure you answered this question, then, in light of that answer. Why were -- was it -- was a determination made that Mrs. Clinton's e-mails would not be potentially responsive to this FOIA request or that they weren't available to the State Department at that time? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Asked and answered. Q You can answer the question. A Neither. Q So no -- did anybody -- did Mr. Wasser think that -- make a determination that Mrs. Clinton's e-mails may contain records responsive to this FOIA request? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Lack of foundation. Q You can answer the question. A The people engaged in the day-to-day activity of searching for records responsive to this request were not aware of that source of potentially responsive documents; therefore, they could not make a determination of whether that source would be responsive or not. Q What does that mean? I guess I'm -- I have understanding what you mean that they were not aware of that source. Could you explain what you mean by that. A They were not aware of the existence of e-mails from the former Secretary that could be potentially responsive to this request. Q So is it my understanding that individuals within the Office of Correspondence and Records did not know Mrs. Clinton was using e-mail to -- for work-related purposes? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Lack of foundation, vague. Q You can answer the question. A Can you clarify the time period? Q The time period would be starting January st, 2009, through -- through November -- well, through February 12th, 2014. MS. WOLVERTON: Same objections. Q You may answer the question. A And can you -- can you phrase the question again so I'm sure I understand it? Q Sure. Is it -- did the Office of Correspondence and Records between that time period of January 2009 and February 2013, was it their belief that Mrs. Clinton did not use e-mail for work-related purposes? A Yes. Q Did that include -- was that -- does that include Mr. Finney? A Yes. Q Did that include the Deputy Executive Secretaries that oversaw that office? A I can't answer that -Q Do you know who would be -A -- definitively. Q -- able to answer that? A We can get back to you on that. Q Okay. Thank you. Do you know if the Executive Secretariat, those that oversaw the Deputy Director, if they knew during that time period that Mrs. Clinton used e-mail to -- for work-related purposes? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: I mean, again, this goes to the processing of FOIA requests and how -- and how specifically this FOIA request was processed. MS. WOLVERTON: I'll also add lack of foundation. And instruct the witness not to answer based on the beyond the scope. You haven't established that those individuals were involved in the FOIA processing. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. Q Would the deputy -- between 2009, January 09, and we'll start off -- and -- and February 12, 14, would the deputy -- would the Executive Secretariat be involved in FOIA -- responding to FOIA requests that were subject -- that may contain Mrs. Clinton's e-mails? A The Executive Secretariat, not the Executive Secretariat staff? Q Correct. A The broader Executive Secretariat? Q The Executive Secretary. A I'm sorry. Are you referring to an individual, to a title, a person in a specific job title or the whole organization? Q A specific person. So the Executive Secretary that would have been Dan Smith, followed by Stephen Mull, and then I don't know the names of the individuals that followed within that position. But that -- that Executive Secretary position, would they have been involved in FOIA requests related to e-mails of Mrs. Clinton during that time period? A The Executive Secretary is the overall head of the Executive Secretariat, of which the secretariat staff and the former Office of Correspondence and Records is a component part. The Executive Secretary has overall responsibility for that, for the secretariat, but is not involved in the day-to-day work of searching for FOIA. Q Would issues related to FOIA requests that involved the Secretary of State rise to the level, not on a day-to-day basis, but when problems arose, to the Executive Secretary position? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. Q You can answer the question. A Occasionally. Q Okay. MS. WOLVERTON: We've been going for about an hour. Could we take a break? MR. BEKESHA: Sure. VIDEO SPECIALIST: This marks the end of Tape Number 1 in the deposition of Karin Lang. We are off the record at 10:09. (A recess was taken.) VIDEO SPECIALIST: Here begins Tape Number in the deposition of Karin Lang. We are back on the record at 10:23. MR. BEKESHA: Thank you. BY MR. BEKESHA: Q Going back to where I think we left off questions. Between the time period of January 21st, 09, and February 12th, 2014, why was the Office of Correspondence and Records not aware that Mrs. Clinton did use e-mail to -- for work-related purposes? A Can you be more specific? Q Sure. The Office of Correspondence and Records was in -- was responsible for processing, storing, archiving Mrs. Clinton's records; wasn't it? A Yes. Q So they would know what record systems or what systems and how Mrs. Clinton communicated; wouldn't they? A The Secretary did not use a State.gov e-mail account. Q Did the Office of Correspondence and Records during that time period know that Mrs. Clinton did not use a State.gov e-mail account? A Yes. Q How did they know that? A When Mrs. -- when former Secretary Clinton came to the State Department in early 2009, as part of her transition the question was raised would she have a State.gov e-mail account, and the transition team advised that she would not. Like her predecessor, she would not have an e-mail account. Q Do you know when specifically that question was asked? A No. Q Do you know who asked that question? A No. Q Do you know who answered that question? A No. Q Do you know when that question was answered? A No. Q Do you know who would know the answers to those questions? A Not specifically. Q What about generally; what offices specifically would have been responsible for asking Mrs. Clinton's transition team if she were to be using a State.gov e-mail account? A The Executive Secretary led the transition. Q And who was the Executive Secretary at the time? A The Executive Secretary at the time was Daniel Smith. Q And did the Office of Correspondence and Records -- let's go with between 2009 and 2013 -ever follow up with requests to see if Mrs. Clinton may have changed her mind or subsequently was using a State.gov e-mail account? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection -- objection. Compound and vague. Q You may answer the question. A Yes. Q And when did that followup take place? A The -- the Office of Correspondence and Records was in constant communication with the S/ES component that provides IT support to the Secretary and other principals. S/ES-IRM. Q So at some point during Mrs. Clinton's tenure, the Office of Correspondence and Records asked S/ES-IRM whether Mrs. Clinton was using a State.gov e-mail account? A Yes. Q When did that take -- when did that happen? A Initially the Office of Correspondence and Records was informed by S/ES-IRM that Secretary Clinton would not have an e-mail account. Q When did that initial -- when were they initially informed? A Sometime in the time frame of the end of 08 to early 2009. Q Do you know who within the Office of Correspondence and Records was informed of that? A Clarence Finney. Q And do you know who informed him of that? A No. Q Did -- was the office -- did the office of -- did IRM inform Mr. Finney that Mrs. Clinton would be using an e-mail account, while she was Secretary of State, for work-related purposes? A No. Q Did Mr. Finney ask IRM whether Mrs. Clinton was going to be using any e-mail address to conduct government business while she was Secretary of State? A Can you clarify the question? Q Sure. When IRM informed Mr. Finney that Mrs. Clinton would not be using a State.gov e-mail account, did Mr. Finney at that point or a subsequent point ask IRM if Mrs. Clinton was going to be using another e-mail -- a non-State.gov e-mail account for work-related purposes? A No. Q He did not ask, or you don't know if he asked? Sorry, I was just unclear on your answer. A No, he did not ask. Q Okay. And you said that there were communications between the Office of Correspondence and Records and IRM at other points about whether or not Mrs. Clinton was using a State.gov e-mail account? Is that correct? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Mischaracterizing former testimony, and I would just ask you to clarify which IRM you are referring to. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. I'm sorry. Q The S/ES-IRM. Were there subsequent conversations related to Mrs. Clinton's -- whether or not Mrs. Clinton was using a State.gov e-mail account between S/ES-IRM and the Office of Correspondence and Records? A Yes. Q And when did those conversations or discussions take place? A In -- when Mrs. Clinton's photo appeared in the media with her using -- appearing to use some sort of a mobile device, Clarence Finney checked with S/ES-IRM to confirm whether or not she still -whether the answer was still that she did not have a State.gov e-mail account. Q Do you recall the time period of that? A Not specifically. Q Okay. What did IRM -- in response to that question by Mr. Finney, what did S/ES-IRM inform Mr. Finney? A That she still did not have a State.gov e-mail account. Q How do you know this? A Through conversations with Clarence Finney. Q Okay. What else -- what else -- what else did they discuss at that time? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. And extends beyond the notice 30(b)(6)topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. Q Regarding -- did Mr. Finney follow up with IRM after that about whether or not Mrs. Clinton was using a State.gov e-mail account? A Not that I'm aware. Q Okay. Do you know if IRM -- S/ES-IRM informed -- sorry. Let me take a step back. Do you know who Mr. Finney was having that conversation with -MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Asked and answered. Q -- at S/ES-IRM? A No, not specifically. Q Do you know who would know the answer to that question? A Not specifically. Q Would Mr. Finney have the answer to that question? Would he know who he spoke with? A He indicates he does not recall. Q How many times have you spoken with Mr. Finney about Mrs. Clinton's -- about FOIA requests related to -- let's take a step back. When you first started as Director, did you speak with Mr. Finney about e-mail records of Mrs. Clinton as they would relate to FOIA requests? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. Q When did you speak to Mr. Finney about the testimony you just gave? A Over the past two or three weeks preparing for this testimony. Q Okay. Approximately how many times during the past two to three weeks did you speak with him? A Approximately three or four times. Q For approximately how many hours total? A For approximately -- probably not more than three hours. Q And what did Mr. Finney tell you about his knowledge of Mrs. Clinton's e-mail usage as it relates to FOIA requests? A Can you specify a time frame? Q Just Mr. Finney's general knowledge between -- we'll start off between January 2009 and February 2013. A Mr. Finney was not aware of e-mail usage by the former Secretary. Q Did Mr. Finney ever receive an e-mail from Mrs. Clinton during that time period? A No. Q Did Mrs. -- Mr. Finney ever send an e-mail to Mrs. Clinton during that time period? A No. Q Was Mr. Finney ever cc'd on an e-mail either from or to the -- Mrs. Clinton during that time period? A No. Q During the time period 2013 through the initial response in this request in February of 14, what did Mr. Finney know about Mrs. Clinton's use of e-mail as it related to FOIA? A He was not aware that there was e-mail that would be responsive to FOIA requests. Q Okay. Did Mr. Finney -- besides asking S/ES-IRM if Mrs. Clinton was using a State.gov e-mail account, did Mr. Finney ask anyone else within the department? A No. Q Did Mr. Finney -- did Mr. Finney and the person in IRM or just generally IRM after the conversation, after he saw the photo in the media, did he -- were there any other discussions with someone in S/ES-IRM about Mrs. Clinton's non use of a State.gov e-mail account? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Mischaracterizes the testimony. Q You may answer the question. A Can you clarify the question? Q Sure. We talked about Mr. Finney having communications with S/ES-IRM after he saw a photo. Were there additional conversations after that at another point, after that discussion? A Can you be more specific? Conversations about what? Q About whether or not Mrs. Clinton had a State.gov e-mail account. A No. Q Sure. What did -- what did Mr. Finney tell you about seeing the photo? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague, and extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: I mean, this goes to how the -- how the witness has knowledge about the information we're asking. We're asking about Mr. Finney's knowledge, the State Department's knowledge of Mrs. Clinton's use of e-mail as it relates to FOIA requests. MS. WOLVERTON: You could tailor your question accordingly. Q What did Mr. Finney tell you about the photo and what he thought in light of FOIA requests for Mrs. Clinton's e-mails? A He did not see a direct connection between the photo and FOIA requests for Mrs. Clinton's e-mails. Q Did Mr. Finney ever ask IRM what e-mail address Mrs. Clinton was using? MS. WOLVERTON: Again, I'll ask that you clarify which IRM you're referencing. Q The S/ES-IRM. A No. He asked if she had a State.gov account. Q Did Mr. Finney ever have conversations with the State Department general IRM component or bureau about Mrs. Clinton's -- whether or not Mrs. Clinton was using a State.gov e-mail account? A Not to my knowledge. But there would be no reason to talk to the bureau of IRM. Q Did Mr. Finney ever talk to the bureau of IRM about Mrs. Clinton's use of e-mail? A Not to my knowledge. Q Did anybody that worked for Mr. Finney between January 2009 and, let's say, February 2013 ask Mr. Finney about Mrs. Clinton's -- whether or not Mrs. Clinton had a State Department e-mail account? A I don't have that information. Q Who would have that information? A Not all of the employees who worked for Mr. Finney at that time are still employed by the State Department. Q Would Mr. Finney potentially have that information? A Possibly. Can you be more -- can you specify your question a little more? Q Sure. Yeah. I'm just wondering, would Mr. Finney know whether or not he had conversations with individuals that reported to him about Mrs. Clinton's use or nonuse of a State.gov e-mail account. A I -- I really have no additional information on that. Q Okay. In response to this specific FOIA request, between May 21st, 2013, and February 12th, 14, was Ms. Abedin's e-mail searched for potentially responsive records? A No. Q Why not? A Mr. Finney made the determination that the bureau -- within the Executive Secretariat, the Executive Director's office, the Human Resources office, was the place likely to contain responsive documents. Q So is it my understanding that no -- no individual employee's files were searched for records responsive to this FOIA request prior to February 12th, 2014? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Lack of foundation, and vague. Q You may answer the question. A Can -- I'm not sure I understand the question. Q Sure. You mentioned earlier that Mr. Wasser searched STARS, STEPS, and CARS for records responsive to this FOIA request. Were any additional systems of records searched between the time of the request and February of 2014 for potentially responsive records? A Yes. Q What else? Where else did he search? A You mean within the Executive Secretariat? Q Yes. A The Correspondence and Records unit tasked the Executive Director's office, the Human Resources officer, to search for responsive documents. Q Okay. And when did that tasking take place? A Late November 2013. Q And within the Office of the Executive Director, what happened next after it was tasked? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: I mean, this goes to the heart of the processing of the FOIA request with respect to Mrs. Clinton's -- Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mails. MS. WOLVERTON: There's no foundation. You could ask a question about whether there were e-mails there. Q What records did the Executive Director's office -- what record systems were -- what records were searched during that time period? A The human resource -- Human Resources officer within the Executive Director's office maintained hard-copy files of personnel-related matters and searched those files. Q And what about the Office of the Executive Director? Was that a different -- is that just one office? Maybe I misunderstood your answer before. A Human Resources is a subcomponent of the Office of the Executive Director. Q Okay. So the only tasking was to the HR component of the Executive Director. Is that correct? A The tasking was to the Executive Director as the overall director of that office, who then chose which component of that office would be the place -- would be reasonably likely to contain responsive records, in this case the Human Resources component. Q Okay. And who made that determination within the -- within the Office of the Executive Director, who made the determination to task only the HR component? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. Q Would the Executive Director's office had e-mail -- have e-mail records of Ms. Abedin and Mrs. Clinton in their possession? A Can you clarify the question? Q Sure. It was tasked to the Executive Director's office. And I'm wondering -- I'm trying to get at, were e-mail records of Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin potentially within the record systems of the Executive Director? A The way the State Department stores e-mails is based on the custodian. So if employees of the -- of that office, that Executive Director's office, had exchanged e-mails with Secretary Clinton or Ms. Abedin, it's possible that those e-mails could have resided within their electronic archives, the employees within that office. Q Okay. Were any of those searches conducted during that time period? A During which time period? Q Prior to -- from the time of the FOIA request to February of 2014. A No. Q Okay. Why not? A The Human Resources officer made the determination that the responsive records would be located in the hard-copy personnel files. Q Okay. So after that happened and after the searches were conducted, what did Mr. Wasser do next? A He prepared a response for Mr. Finney's signature to return the responsive documents to the IPS case analyst. Q Okay. A And filled out the DS-1748. Q And what happened next? A The Executive Secretariat returned the response to the IPS case analyst. Q Okay. And then what happened? A I don't understand your question. Q What did the case analyst do once they received the DS-1748 from the Executive Secretariat? A The IPS case analyst is typically gathering the responses from all the various offices that have been tasked. In this case that would include the Office of the Legal Advisor, the Executive Secretariat, and the Bureau of Human Resources. Q Okay. Did -- does the case analyst -did -- in this instance did the case analyst review the different databases that were searched? A Excuse me. I'm sorry, can you be more specific about which databases? Q Sure. The databases that the Executive Secretariat searched. Does the case analyst, or did in this instance, did the case analyst look to see what databases were searched? A The case analyst reviews the responses from the bureau, in this case the Executive Secretariat, to ensure that the -- that the databases are clearly listed on the 1748 tasker. Q Does the case analyst generally or specific in this case -- or let's start generally, does the case analyst review the databases and the searches that were conducted to determine whether or not the searches were sufficient? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. A Can you be more specific? Q Sure. When the case analyst reviews the information that's returned to the case analyst, does the case analyst do any substantive review of what is provided to the case analyst? A The case analyst reviews the documents that are provided to -- at that point they are considered potentially responsive documents. The case analyst reviews those documents to determine whether or not they are actually responsive to the request. Q So the case analyst does not review the searches, specifically review the methods and means of the searches that were conducted? A The case analyst generally reviews the 48 tasker to ensure it's complete and -- and that the searches conducted are clearly listed. Q Okay. So in this instance, after the case analyst received the tasker back from the various components, what happened next? A Then, working with the Office of the Legal Advisor, the -- the litigation case analyst compiles -- compiled the results. Q Okay. What happened after that? A Then the -- the litigation case analyst prepared the response letter to the requester, and the documents were prepared for release. Q Okay. And then what happened after that? A Then the letter was drafted to the requester. Q And who drafted -- who drafts the letter? Or in this instance who drafted the letter? A The litigation case analyst drafts the letter. I'm not sure which of the two litigation case analysts drafted the letter. Q Okay. And then the letter was sent on February 12th, 2014? A Correct. Q What happened after that? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. Q What happens -- is a FOIA -- once the letter is sent -- once the letter was sent, what happens within IPS -- or what happened in IPS related to this FOIA request? A Then the case -- well, the case is normally closed when the response is provided to the requester. Q Was the case closed in this instance? A No. Because it was a litigation case. Q So what happened? Does it -- I guess my -- does it stay open, does the file stay active, what happens? A It stays open until the litigation is resolved. Q Okay. When was the -- was the litigation resolved shortly thereafter? A I believe it was resolved in March of 14. Q Okay. And what happened at that point -MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Q -- with the file? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. Q You can answer the question. A The -- then the case is closed. Q Okay. And what does that mean? What administrative procedure takes place? A It just means that in the software that IPS uses to manage its caseload, the case is closed. Which is important for statistical tracking purposes. Q Okay. And is the case file kept for a certain period of time after a case is closed? A Yes. Q Do you know for how long? A I'm sorry. I don't have that information. Q Did you review the case file related to this FOIA request in preparation for today? A Can you be more specific? Q Sure. The case -- you said earlier on in your testimony that a case file was created for this FOIA request when it was received in May 2013. Does that case file still exist today? A The -- the case is -- primarily resides in the Freedoms software that IPS uses. Q Is the same -- what is included in that system, in the Freedoms system? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Just I'm going to note that at this point the questions are really straying far beyond the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. And instruct the witness not to answer. Q What did you review -- what materials did you review in preparation for today related to the -- specifically to the processing of the FOIA request from the time it was submitted until the case was closed? A I'll direct you to Exhibit 2. Four -- Tab A. Q Did you review anything -- any other documents related to the processing of the FOIA request, besides Tab -- besides what is -- the document in Tab 4A? A Yes. Q What else did you review about the processing of the FOIA request from the time the FOIA request was submitted until the time the case was closed sometime in, it sounded like early 2014? A I reviewed the -- the Freedoms software case for this and various e-mail traffic between individuals working on this FOIA request. Q Okay. All right. We're going to move ahead to 15. Are you aware that this FOIA litigation was reopened in June of 2015? A Yes. Q When the case was reopened, what happened at IPS related to this FOIA request? A When the case was reopened, it was assigned to a litigation analyst. Q And who was that litigation analyst? A Julia Navarro. Q Is that person still at the Department of State? A Yes. Q Okay. And what did Ms. Navarro -- sorry, Mr. or Ms. Navarro? A Ms. Navarro. Q What did Ms. Navarro do when it was assigned to her? A She reopened the case and awaited further instruction from the Office of the Legal Advisor. Q Okay. After she received instruction from the Office of the Legal Advisor, what did she do? A She tasked additional searches per the instructions from the Office of the Legal Advisor. Q Okay. And what -- when did that happen? When did she task additional searches? A In late July 2015. Q Okay. And what were the searches that she tasked? A The searches that she tasked were based upon the discussions between the plaintiff and the -- and the department, the agreement that was reached on search terms and dates. Q Okay. Who did she task? A Let's go to Tab 3B. Q What -- who did she task? A As indicated on Page 3 of the declaration, the -- the bureaus and offices that were tasked were the Bureau of Human Resources, the Office of the Executive Secretariat, the Office of the Legal Advisor, the Office of the Under Secretary for Management, and the Central Foreign Policy records. Q And were those the same offices that were tasked initially, the first time around, when the FOIA request was received? A The addition was the Office of the Under Secretary For Management. Q And why was that office added? A It was determined at that time that that office might have responsive records. Q Why was it -- why was that determination not made during the initial processing of this FOIA request? A The initial -- the -- the offices that were initially tasked were tasked because a determination was made that they were reasonably likely to contain records. Q And who made the determination that the Office of the Under Secretary for Management may have potentially responsive records? A With any case in litigation, the discussion is between the Office of the Legal Advisor and the IPS office. Q And do you know who made, specifically made this determination? A No. Q Do you know who would know who made that determination? A The IPS case analyst. Q And who was that? A Julia Navarro. Q Okay. So what did -- so the next step was Ms. Navarro tasked out to the various departments. One of those departments was the office -- or one of those components was the Office of the Executive Secretariat. Is that correct? A Correct. Q Who received that tasking within the Office of the Executive Secretariat? A Clarence Finney. Q When did Mr. Finney receive that tasking? A In late July 2015. Q And what did Mr. Finney do next? A He tasked searches. Q Who did he task? A He tasked the program assistant in the Office of Correspondence and Records. Q And who was that at the time? A Kevin Greer. Q Okay. And what did -- did Mr. Finney instruct Mr. Greer what searches -- where to search, what searches needed to be done? A Yes. Q And what did he tell him? A He instructed him to search the -- the Huma Abedin State.gov e-mail account. Q What else did he ask him to search? A Let's refer to the same, Number 4, Tab D. MS. WOLVERTON: I'm sorry. Do you mean Tab 3D? THE WITNESS: Yes, I'm sorry. Yes. 3D. Q Where did Mr. Finney task the case analyst to search? A Refer to the top of Page 8 of the declaration. The -- the program assistant and the S/ES management analyst both participated in these searches. For the State.gov e-mail records of Ms. Mills, Ms. Abedin, the former Human Resources officer Cynthia Motley, and a former senior advisor in the Office of the White House Liaison, Heather Samuelson. Q How -- why were those individuals' e-mails determined to maybe contain potentially responsive records? A Based on the subject matter of the -- of the request. Q Were those -- did Mr. Finney task someone to search those record systems during the initial processing of the FOIA request? A No. Q Why not? A He made a determination in the initial processing that the Human Resources office was the location of likely responsive records. Q And he made -- and he was the one that made the determination during the supplemental search to search these e-mail account -- or these record systems? A During the supplemental search, the decision of potentially -- locations to search for potentially responsive records was made in consultation with the Office of the Legal Advisor and the IPS. Q Was Mr. Finney ordered to search these record systems during the supplemental search? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. A The -- the search tasker and e-mail instruction that came from IPS indicated, based on the discussions and agreement between the two parties, what would be searched. Q So Mr. Finney did not make the determination where to search. A Correct. Q Who -- who -- I guess the question is, who made that determination, then? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Asked and answered. Q A specific individual, not -- not the title or the office they were in. Who was the individual, the specific individual, that made the determination to search the e-mail -- search the State.gov e-mail records of Ms. Mills, Ms. Abedin, Ms. Motley, and Ms. Samuelson? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Asked and answered, and also calls for information covered by the attorney-client privilege. So I'll instruct the witness not to answer on that basis. Q Was Mr. Finney told by the IPS case analyst where to conduct its searches, where he should conduct -- you said that it was in consultation with the Office of the Legal Advisor and IPS, talking about IPS specifically, was -- did IPS instruct Mr. Finney to search the State.gov e-mail records of Ms. Mills, Ms. Abedin, Ms. Motley, and Ms. Samuelson? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Asked and answered, and mischaracterizes former testimony. Q You may answer the question. A Yes. Q Who? Who was that individual at IPS? A Who -- who instructed -Q Who instructed Mr. Finney to search the State.gov e-mail records of Ms. Mills, Ms. Abedin, Ms. Motley, and Ms. Samuelson? A I believe it was Ms. Julia Navarro or his branch chief, Susan Weetman. Q But you're not sure which one of the two of them gave those instructions to Mr. Finney? A They were both working on this case at this point. Q Okay. Why did those individuals not instruct Mr. Finney to search those -- search the State.gov e-mail records of Ms. Mills, Ms. Abedin, Ms. Motley, and Ms. Samuelson during the initial processing of the FOIA request? A The initial processing of the FOIA request was less detailed instruction. Q Less detailed instruction from whom? A From the IPS analyst, to the Office of the Executive Secretariat. Q Why was it less detailed instructions? A The office -- the 1748 tasker contains general instructions for offices. When cases move into litigation, sometimes they're subject to very specific instructions based on the status of litigation. Q In -- in this instance, based on this, because the initial request began processing prior to litigation, such instructions did not take place? A No, that's not accurate. Q Okay. Let's walk back then to the initial processing of the FOIA request. Why were detailed instructions not provided to Mr. Finney as to where to search within the Office of the Executive Secretariat? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. Q You may answer the question. A In general, IPS, when IPS tasks searches to various components within the State Department, State Department practice is that the bureau or office that is tasked, those are the subject-matter experts and are best placed to determine where responsive records are likely to be located. Q Okay. Did the FOIA requests change between the initial processing of the request and the supplemental search? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The question assumes facts not in evidence. Q You may answer the question. A After the -- when the second -- the supplemental searches were tasked, the instructions to the searching offices had become more specific through the result of discussions between the two parties and the agreement that was reached between the two parties. Q So what happened after Mr. Finney was tasked to search -- to have a supplemental search of records within the Office of the Executive Secretariat? A Those searches were conducted. Q And how were those searches conducted? A Those searches were conducted using Microsoft Outlook. Q Could you be more specific? Was it a keyword search? Was it a keyword search? A Yes. Q Did -- did Ms. Mills have -- was a search -- Outlook search done on Ms. Mills's PST file? A Yes. Q Was a separate search conducted of Ms. Abedin's PST file? A Yes. Q Was a separate search conducted on Ms. Motley's PST file? A Yes. Q And the same for Ms. Samuelson? A Yes. Q Does the Office of Correspondence and Records have a way to search all of those e-mail accounts at one time? A Not consistently. Q What do you mean by that? A If all -- searching PSTs involves indexing them and loading them on a -- what we call a virtual machine. And if they were all loaded at the same time and prepared to be searched at the same time, they could be searched at the same time. Q Is that normally how the records are created -- the PST files are created? A That is not how PST files are created. Q Okay. How is a PST file created? A I don't have specific information on that. Q Okay. Were any other PST files searched at that time? A Can you be more specific? Q Within the Office of the Secretary, were any other PST files searched at that time? A Within the search that was conducted? Q Yes, within the search that -- the supplemental search that was conducted in response to this FOIA request. A Not that I'm aware of. Q Why not? A Because those were determined to be the -the PST files that would be likely to contain responsive records. Q Okay. Mrs. Clinton has stated and it's also been testified to in this case that it was her e-mail practice to e-mail government employees on their dot gov e-mail accounts. She said and the testimony said the reason for this practice was so work e-mails would be immediately captured and preserved in government recordkeeping systems. Was the State Department aware at any time between January 2009 and February -- I guess we're in July of 2015, that that was Mrs. Clinton's e-mail practice? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence, and extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. On that basis, I'll instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: I mean, this goes to whether or not records were searched for Mrs. Clinton's e-mail. That falls directly within the scope of the (b)(6). MS. WOLVERTON: You can tailor your question accordingly. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. Q At any point while processing this FOIA request, did the State -- did the Office of Correspondence and Management, either Mr. Finney or someone else, know that Mrs. Clinton's practice was to e-mail government employees on their dot gov or we can specify, was it her practice to e-mail State Department employees on their State.gov e-mail accounts so that they were captured and preserved in government recordkeeping systems? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence, and compound. Q You may answer the question. A I'm not sure I understand the question. Q Sure. While Mr. Finney -- while the office of correspondence and management was responding to FOIA requests, did they know, did someone within that office know that Mrs. Clinton's practice to preserve government e-mails was to do so by -- by e-mailing State Department employees on their State.gov e-mail account? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence. A During what time frame? Q Between January 2009 and February -- we'll change it to February 2014. A No. MS. WOLVERTON: Same objection. A No. Q Did Mr. Finney or anyone else talk to -did Mr. Finney ever inquire about how Mrs. Clinton -- strike that. Does the State Department now know that that was Mrs. Clinton's practice? And by that I mean to e-mail State Department employees on a State.gov e-mail account. MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence. Q You can answer the question. A I'm not sure I understand the question. Q Okay. Mrs. Clinton has said, and testimony in this case has been provided, that Mrs. Clinton's recordkeeping process was to e-mail government employees on their dot gov e-mail account. Is the State Department now aware that that was Mrs. Clinton's practice? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence. A The State Department is aware that Mrs. Clinton has made those statements. Q Okay. When did the State Department become aware of those, that Mrs. Clinton has made such statements? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Goes beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. On that ground, I'll instruct the witness not to answer. Q Now that the State Department knows that that was what Mrs. Clinton -- does the State Department believe that was an adequate process to capture e-mails of conducting official government business? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer on that ground. Q Now that the State Department is aware that Mrs. Clinton has said that this was her practice, does the State Department believe that their searches in response to this FOIA request, either the initial search, during the initial time period, were sufficient? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for a legal conclusion. Q You may answer the question. A I'm not a lawyer, so I won't make a legal conclusion. Q In -- in your personal opinion. MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer on that ground. Q When you spoke with Mr. Finney in preparation for today, did you discuss the processing of this FOIA request as it relates to Mrs. Clinton's statement about how she managed her e-mails? A Not specifically. Q Did you talk about it generally? A Yes. Q What did you discuss? A The initial search and the subsequent searches. Q Does Mr. Finney believe that additional searches should have been conducted because of Mrs. Clinton's statement that she -- her practice was to preserve e-mails by e-mailing State Department employees on a State.gov e-mail account? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for a legal conclusion. Q You may answer the question. A No. Q What did Mr. Finney say when discussing the searches that were conducted in response to this FOIA request before the case -- the initial searches that were conducted? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. Q What -- sorry. A Regarding e-mail searches, or regarding the search that was conducted? Q Regarding the search that was conducted, yes. Sorry. A That at that time it was his determination that the records that were searched were the places that were reasonably likely to contain responsive records. Q And that did not include searches of any e-mail systems. Is that correct? A At that time, it did not. Q Okay. What about during the supplemental search; did you discuss with Mr. Finney those searches that were conducted? A Yes. Q And what did he say about those searches, about the supplemental searches? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. Q You may answer the question. A Can you clarify the question? Q Sure. Does he believe -- did you guys discuss -- did you discuss with Mr. Finney whether the searches that were -- the supplemental searches that were conducted were sufficient to find all potentially responsive records? A The supplemental searches we've been talking about do not include the -- the former Secretary Clinton collection of e-mails, which was also searched. Q Thank you. Because Mrs. Clinton has stated that her practice was to capture and preserve government records by e-mailing other State Department -- other employees on a government e-mail address, including a State.gov e-mail account, does Ms. -- did you and Mr. Finney discuss whether or not the supplemental searches were sufficient? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence, asked and answered. Q You may answer the question. A I think you're linking two separate things that are not linked. Q What do you mean by that, if you could elaborate? A The -- the supplemental searches were sufficient. They included a search of the former Secretary Clinton e-mail collection. The practice -- the way the State Department stores e-mail records is by custodian, by the employee who sent or received those e-mails. So in order to search, for example, for Secretary Clinton's e-mails, if they were stored in other custodians' electronic archives, it would not be possible to do that except by searching individual custodian by individual custodian, which would not be reasonably possible. Q Why -- why would that not be reasonably possible? A The department has 70,000 employees worldwide. Q But -- so does that mean that Mrs. -- the statement that e-mails would be immediately captured and preserved in government recordkeeping systems was not in compliance with the State Department policy and did not allow the State Department to sufficiently search for records responsive to this FOIA request? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for a legal conclusion, and compound. And in that regard extends beyond the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. On that basis, I'll instruct the witness not to answer that question. Q Okay. We can come back to that. Let's turn our attention from this specific -MS. BERMAN: Do you want to take a break? THE WITNESS: Is this a good time to take a break? MR. BEKESHA: Sure. I actually had a couple more questions about the processing of this specific FOIA request and then moving on. I don't know if it makes sense to finish that first. MS. WOLVERTON: What do you think? THE WITNESS: Let's take a break now. MR. BEKESHA: Okay. Thank you. VIDEO SPECIALIST: This marks the end of Tape Number 2 in the deposition of Karin Lang. We are off the record at 11:16. (A recess was taken.) VIDEO SPECIALIST: Here begins Tape Number in the deposition of Karin Lang. We are back on the record at 11:30. MR. BEKESHA: Thank you. BY MR. BEKESHA: Q I just have a few more very quick questions about the processing of this FOIA request specifically. After the State Department filed its motion for summary judgment in this case, the State Department informed the court that it located additional sources of documents that originated within the Office of the Secretary that are reasonably likely to contain records responsive to the plaintiff's request. Do you know what those additional sources of documents are that were located? A Can you clarify the date of that filing? Q Sure. It would have been roughly -- this filing was in I believe late January, early February. The motion for summary judgment was filed I believe in November of last year, of 2015. So this would have been -- this statement would been made late January, early February of 2016. A Yes, I believe so. Q And what are those additional sources? A There were certain files that were electronic files associated with former employees that were in addition to e-mails that were found to be located still in the S/ES-IRM office. Q Okay. And what? What electronic files are they, just generally? A They're personal drives, which can contain a variety of information. Q Did they include PST files? A No. The PST files were searched. Q Okay. Okay. Did it include e-mail -- electronic versions of e-mails in that drive or in that new source of information? A It could contain a variety of file types. Q Okay. Has that -- have those additional sources been searched for records responsive to this case? A Yes, I believe so. Q Okay. Have any records -- were any records located? A No. Q Okay. To the State Department's knowledge, since Judicial Watch submitted its FOIA request in May -- on May 21st, 2013, has any potentially responsive e-mails been destroyed or lost? A Can you narrow that question? Q Not really. A Okay. Q I wish I could, to help you out. But, you know, since the FOIA request was submitted, were -or, you know, I can be a little more -- since the State Department received Judicial Watch's FOIA request at issue in this case, is the State Department aware of any potentially responsive e-mails that have been destroyed or lost? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The question extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. On that basis, I'll instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. I'll clarify. Q To the State Department's knowledge, since the State Department received the FOIA request at issue in this case, has any potential responsive e-mails of Mrs. Clinton or Ms. Abedin been destroyed or lost? A It's not possible to answer that question because on the date that the -- that the initial FOIA request was received, there were e-mails from former Secretary Clinton and Ms. Abedin that were not in the possession of the State Department. The State Department is not in a position to say whether e-mails subsequent to that -- e-mails that existed on that date were subsequently lost. Q Okay. You mentioned earlier that a litigation hold was created or prepared when this case entered litigation. Who was -- who was the litigation hold sent to? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Mischaracterizes testimony. Q You may answer the question. A I did not state that a litigation hold was placed on this case. Q Was a litigation hold or some type of notice about the litigation created once this case entered litigation? A Can you be more specific? Q Sure. When Judicial Watch filed its lawsuit and it was served on the department, did the department take any steps to ensure that any responsive e-mails of Mrs. Clinton or Ms. Abedin were not destroyed or lost? A Again, as we stated earlier, at the time that the initial -- the case initially went into litigation, the department was not in possession or control of former Secretary Clinton's e-mail collection, so it could not have taken steps regarding those documents. Q Sure. Okay. What about, you mentioned that in response to this FOIA request, the e-mail files of Ms. Abedin, Ms. Mills, Ms. Motley, and Ms. Samuelson were searched. Were any steps taken, after the State Department was served with the lawsuit in this case, to ensure that those e-mails -- that e-mails that may be potentially responsive in this FOIA request were not destroyed or lost? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The question extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer on that basis. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. Q Ms. Abedin, in addition to using a non-State.gov e-mail account, also used a State.gov e-mail account for work-related purposes. Is that correct? A Yes. Q What steps were taken when -- when Judicial Watch filed its complaint and the State Department was served and aware of the complaint, were any steps taken to ensure that Ms. Abedin's e-mails on the State.gov, her State Department e-mail account, were not destroyed or lost? A S/ES-IRM as a matter of practice preserved the e-mails and the -- and the electronic material from Ms. Abedin after she departed the State Department. Q Okay. How -- how does IRM, S/ES-IRM become aware of the litigation? How did it become aware that this case was in litigation? A I don't think S/ES-IRM was specifically informed that this case was in litigation. Q Okay. So how would -- if they were not specifically informed, how would they ensure that no -- none of Ms. Abedin's e-mails were destroyed or lost after litigation began? A S/ES-IRM did not destroy or -- did not destroy any of its PSTs in its possession. Q Okay. How -- for how long does S/ES-IRM archive, maintain, retain PST files for former employees? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The question extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer on that ground. Q With respect to Ms. Abedin's State Department e-mail account, how long is S/ES-IRM planning to maintain, preserve, retain her -- the PST file? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer on that basis. Q Okay. Let's switch gears from talking about the specific FOIA request to issues generally related to the processing of FOIA requests for Mrs. Clinton -- for e-mails of Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin while Mrs. Clinton was Secretary of State. Do you -- are you aware of any FOIA requests that were received by the State Department for Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mails during this time period? A Yes. Q Do you know approximately how many FOIA requests were received? A Can you be more specific? Q Sure. How many FOIA requests were received, while Mrs. Clinton was Secretary of State, that may have implicated Mrs. Clinton or Ms. Abedin's e-mails? A I can't answer that definitively, because that's not the way the State Department keeps data on FOIA. Q Okay. Do you know who may have the answer to that question? A The State Department doesn't keep data that way. Q Okay. Do you know of any specific FOIA requests during the time period Mrs. Clinton was in office that may have implicated Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mails? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: I mean, the topic is the processing of FOIA requests for e-mails of Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin during Mrs. Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. This question goes directly to the processing of FOIA requests for e-mails of Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin during Mrs. Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. MS. WOLVERTON: The notice topic, and as you have described this line of questioning, is the general processing of FOIA requests, but your question was directed to specific FOIA requests. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. I mean, the -- I mean, the 30(b)(6) -- the order of the court says regarding the processing of FOIA requests. And I'm asking about the processing of FOIA requests. MS. WOLVERTON: But you asked about specific requests. MR. BEKESHA: I asked if she recalled any specific requests. The State Department, as you probably recall, agreed to this line of questioning. You agreed to the scope of the 30(b)(6). This is language that we jointly proposed to Judge Sullivan. Judge Sullivan approved it. It talks about the processing of FOIA requests that implicate Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mails, and we are asking questions about that. That is not outside the scope of the 30(b)(6). MS. WOLVERTON: I believe that we did agree, though, that specifically excluded from the requests are -- I'm sorry, the scope of discovery generally, are questions about FOIA requests beyond the request that is the subject of this action. So while questions about processing in general are fine, there's no basis for asking about specific FOIA requests other than the one that's at issue in this case. MR. BEKESHA: And the question was not asking for details about specific questions about specific processing of the FOIA requests. I was just asking the witness if she recalled any specific FOIA requests that came in during that time period for Mrs. Clinton -- that implicated Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mails. MS. WOLVERTON: Okay. Could we go off the record for a minute? MR. BEKESHA: Sure. VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are going off the record. The time is 11:42. (A recess was taken.) VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are back on the record. The time is 11:44. MR. BEKESHA: Thank you. Could I ask the court reporter to read back the last question. (The reporter read the record as follows: "QUESTION: Do you know of any specific FOIA requests during the time period Mrs. Clinton was in office that may have implicated Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mails?") MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. Q You may answer the question. A Yes. Q Okay. During -- while Mrs. Clinton was in office, and FOIA requests were received by the department for -- that may implicate Mrs. Clinton's e-mails or Mrs. Abedin's e-mails, who was responsible for that, for the processing of those FOIA requests, within the Office of the Executive Secretariat? A The Office of Correspondence and Records, which during Mrs. Clinton -- Secretary Clinton's tenure was an independent office within the Executive Secretariat, was responsible for processing all FOIA requests directed to the Office of the Secretary or the deputy secretaries or the under secretaries. Q Okay. And if the FOIA requests came in that implicated Ms. Abedin's e-mails, how would the State Department go about searching Ms. Abedin's e-mails for records responsive to the FOIA request? A I'm sorry. Can you clarify a time frame? Q Sure. I'm sorry. This whole line of questioning is for the time period while Mrs. Clinton was Secretary of State. So if I just say "during this time period," or even if I don't, I'm just referring to the four-year period between January 2009 and February 2013. A Thank you. Q How -- the question was, how would the FOIA requests came in that implicated Mrs. Abedin's e-mails, how would the State Department go about searching for records potentially responsive to the FOIA request? A Such a request, if it was received by the State Department, as we discussed earlier, would be received by IPS and tasked to the Executive Secretariat as appropriate, to the Office of Correspondence and Records. In the Office of Correspondence and Records, the director would examine the request and, based on its content, based on the subject matter, make a determination where responsive records would likely be located, and would task it out appropriately based on that determination. Q Okay. And if that determination was made that Ms. Abedin's e-mail records would be a potential source of potentially responsive records, where would that be tasked? The search -- the search itself, how would -- where would that be tasked? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for speculation. Q You may answer the question. A The general policy of the State Department is that current employees are asked to search their own e-mail records. Q Okay. And if a current employee is -- if Ms. Abedin were to be asked to search her e-mail records, would any -- was any -- would any guidance have been provided to her about how to conduct that search? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for speculation. Q You can answer the question. A General guidance for searchers is provided on the DS-1748 tasker. Q Okay. Would the State Department require Ms. Abedin, who was Deputy Chief of Staff, to conduct the search of her records, or could another staff person within her office search such records? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for speculation. Q You can answer the question. A Generally that kind of decision is left to the individual employee. Q Okay. Does -- when it's tasked from the Correspondence and Records office, does the Correspondence and Records -- when -- when it is returned to the -- to that office, do they review the searches that were conducted? A Can you be more specific? Q Sure. Would the Correspondence and Records office have a discussion with Ms. Abedin about how she conducted the searches? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for speculation. Q You can answer the question. A Not to my knowledge. Q Okay. Would this procedure be the same for a Secretary of State? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for speculation. Q You can answer the question. A Are you specifically referring to an e-mail search? Q Yes, e-mail search. If -- if e-mail is implicated -- if e-mail -- if a FOIA request came in that implicated Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, would the tasking have occurred the same way, even though she was Secretary of State? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for speculation. Q You can answer the question. A Prior to Secretary Kerry, no Secretary of State used a State.gov e-mail address. Q And how does the -- was Mrs. Clinton ever asked to search her e-mails for potentially responsive records during the time period she was Secretary of State? A No. Q Did Mr. Finney ever have any discussions with anyone within the Office of the Secretary about potential -- about FOIA requests that implicated Mrs. Clinton's e-mails? A Can you be more specific? Q During that time period while Mrs. Clinton was in office, did Mr. Finney have any conversations with Ms. Cheryl Mills about FOIA requests that may implicate Mrs. Clinton's e-mails? A No. Q Did he have any discussions with Ms. Abedin during that time period about FOIA requests that may implicate Mrs. Clinton's e-mails? A No. Q Did anybody else within the Correspondence and Records office have -- have conversations with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Mills, and Ms. Abedin about FOIA requests that may implicate Mrs. Clinton's e-mails? A No. Q Did anybody within IPS have any conversations with anyone within the Office of the Secretary about FOIA requests that may implicate Mrs. Clinton's e-mails? A I'm sorry, that question is -- is very broad. Can you be more specific? Q Sure. While Mrs. Clinton was in office, did IPS have any conversations with any individuals within the Office of the Secretary about a FOIA request or about FOIA requests that came into the department that implicated Mrs. Clinton's e-mails? A Not to my knowledge. And I would be surprised to hear. Because normal practice, standard procedure, was for IPS to deal with the Office of Correspondence and Records within the Executive Secretariat. Q Okay. And during that time period, who was the director of IPS? A The time period encompassing the whole four years? Q The whole four years. Yes. Thank you. Sorry about that. A The whole four years. Okay. At the beginning of Secretary Clinton's tenure in -- on -- in January 2009, the director of IPS was Margaret Grafeld. Q Okay. And after -- after her? A She became the Deputy Assistant Secretary supervising IPS in 2010. And for a time there were two acting co-directors of IPS, Charlene Thomas and Alex Galovich. Q Could you spell that last name, please. A With some -- with no degree of certainty, G-A-L-O-V-I-C-H. Q Thank you. A Later in December 2011, Sheryl Walter took over as Director of IPS. She remained Director of IPS until the end of Secretary Clinton's term in 13. Q Okay. Thank you. And you said that Ms. Grafeld became Deputy Assistant Secretary that oversaw IPS in 2010. When did she -- did she hold that position for the remainder of Mrs. Clinton's tenure? A Yes. Q Prior to her taking that position, from January 2009 to 2010, who held that position? A The Deputy Assistant Secretary position? Q Yes. A I believe it was Llewellyn Hedgbeth. Q Could you spell that name, please. To the best of your ability. A L-L-E-W-E-L-L-E-N, H-E-D-G-B-E-T-H. Q Thank you. I think that was the most difficult name so far today. Hopefully they get easier, if there are other names. And those -- the Deputy Assistant Secretary position, who did they report to? Who did they report to during the time period? A The Deputy Assistant Secretary reports to the Assistant Secretary for Administration. Q Okay. And who was that person between 09 and 2013? A At the time Secretary Clinton came to the department, there was an acting Assistant Secretary named Stephen Rodriguez. Q Okay. And how long did he remain acting? A I believe he remained acting until December 2011, when Ambassador Joyce Barr was -- was sworn in as Assistant Secretary For Administration. Q Okay. And did she hold that position through the end of Mrs. Clinton's tenure? A Yes. Q Okay. And who does -- who did they report to? A The Assistant Secretary For Administration reports to the Under Secretary for Management. Q And who is that person? A That person is Patrick Kennedy. Q And did he hold that position for the full four years Mrs. Clinton was in office? A Yes. Q And Mr. Kennedy, does he report directly to the Secretary -- does the Under Secretary for Management report to the Secretary of State? A Yes. Q During this time period while Mrs. Clinton was in office, did the correspondence -- did the Correspondence and Records office, were they aware that Ms. Abedin would use a non-State.gov e-mail account for work-related purposes? A No. Q When did the Correspondence and Records office learn that Ms. Mills -- sorry, Ms. Abedin used a non-State.gov e-mail account for work-related purposes? A The department sent letters to Ms. Abedin in -- and Ms. Mills in March of 2015 seeking information about possible federal records located in -- in non-State.gov accounts. Q And why did they send those letters? A Based on information -- based on a desire to determine whether there was information. Q Okay. During the time period Mrs. Clinton was in office, did the Office of Correspondence and Records ask Ms. Abedin whether she was using a state -- a non-State Department e-mail address to -for work-related purposes? A No. Q Did the Office of Correspondence and Records ask anyone else within the State Department during that time period if Ms. Abedin was using a non-State Department e-mail account for work-related purposes? A No. Q Okay. Do you know if the -- I'll just ask it. Did S/ES-IRM know that Ms. Abedin would use a non-State Department e-mail address to conduct government business during -- during the tenure? A Not to my knowledge. Q Okay. Do you know who would have that information? A Current or former employees of S/ES-IRM. Q Okay. Do you know who the Director of IRM -- S/ES-IRM was during Mrs. Clinton's tenure? A Yes. John Bentel. Q Was he the director the entire time? A I believe so. Q Okay. Thank you. Is Mr. Bentel still an employee of the State Department? A No. Q When did he retire; do you know? A I don't know the exact date. Q Do you have a sense, a time frame generally of when he left the employment of the State Department? MS. WOLVERTON: I'll object here that this line has gone beyond the scope of the notice (b)(6) deposition topic and instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: Okay. Q During -- during Mrs. -- while Mrs. Clinton was in office, was Mrs. Clinton trained with respect to FOIA-related issues? A No. Q During the time period Mrs. Clinton was in office, was Ms. Abedin trained on FOIA-related issues? A No. Q Is that unusual? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague, and extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. Q Were other employees within the Office of the Secretary trained with respect to FOIA-related issues during that time period? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer on that basis. Q During -- while Mrs. Clinton was in office, was anyone within the -- any employees within the Office of the Secretary trained about managing Ms. Abedin's e-mails for FOIA-related purposes? A No. Q Would Ms. -- how would Ms. Mills know what her obligations were when it came to FOIA and her e-mails, if she weren't trained? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. Q You said that Ms. Abedin -- if a FOIA request came in that concerned Ms. Abedin's e-mails, that the normal practice was for the individual employee, so Ms. Abedin, to search her e-mails for records responsive to FOIA. How would she know what to do if she weren't trained to do so? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for speculation, and extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. Q You may answer the question. A The OIG report issued in January of this year found that there was insufficient training of employees generally in the -- in the secretariat regarding FOIA. Q Why did the State Department not train Ms. Abedin and Mrs. Clinton on FOIA-related issues when they -- when they came in? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the notice of the 30(b)(6) deposition notice. I'll instruct the witness not to answer on that basis. Q Why was Ms. Abedin and Ms. Clinton not trained with respect to FOIA and their e-mails while they were in office? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice deposition topic, and I'll instruct the witness not to answer on that basis. Q Did -- did anybody in the State Department ever -- did the State Department ever ask Mrs. Clinton if she was using a personal e-mail account to conduct work-related business? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer on that basis. Q When responding to -- when responding to FOIA requests, did anybody in the State Department while Mrs. Clinton was in office ever ask Mrs. Clinton if she was using a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business? A No. Q Let's switch gears again and talk about processing of FOIA requests for e-mails of Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Abedin subsequent to Mrs. Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. So if I ask a question, you can assume it would be the time period, let's say, between February 2013 and March 2015. Are you aware of any FOIA requests submitted to the State Department between February 13 and March 2015 that implicated Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mails? A Yes. Q Do you know approximately how many? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the notice of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. Q You may answer the question. A As I indicated earlier, the State Department doesn't keep FOIA records in that way. Q Besides the FOIA requests at issue in this case, do you recall any specific FOIA requests or do you know of any specific FOIA requests that were received for -- by the State Department between February 2013 and March 2015 that implicated Mrs. -February 2013 and March 2015? MS. BERMAN: That's not what you said before. MS. WOLVERTON: Anyway, in any event, objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice (b)(6) deposition topic. MS. BERMAN: You said that the time frame for this line of questioning was February 2014 to March 2015. MS. WOLVERTON: I think he said '13. Could -MR. BEKESHA: Could you read -MS. WOLVERTON: Or just clarify it. MS. BERMAN: Just clarify it. Q Okay. I've been talking about February 13, when Mrs. Clinton left office. A That is what I understood. Q Thank you. MS. BERMAN: Sorry, everyone. Q So I will -- I'll ask the question again. Besides this specific -- besides this specific FOIA request at issue in this case, do you know of any specific FOIA requests received by the department between February 2013 and March 2015 that may implicate Mrs. Clinton's and Ms. Abedin's e-mails? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. Q You may answer the question. A Yes. Q Okay. During this time period, who within the Office of Correspondence and Records was in charge of processing such FOIA requests? A Clarence Finney. Q Okay. During this time period, because Mrs. Clinton was out of office and so was Ms. Abedin, who had access -- where were her e-mail records located? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. Whose e-mail records? Q Ms. Abedin's e-mail records located. I apologize. A Ms. Abedin's e-mail records at that point were located in S/ES-IRM. Q And when -- how long were they located there? A From the time she left office. Q And they're currently still there? A Yes. Q Okay. Thank you. And who would have been in charge of reviewing Ms. Abedin's e-mails during that time period? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. Q Who within S/ES-IRM responsibility would it be to search these archived PST files? MS. WOLVERTON: To clarify, you mean for purposes of processing FOIA? MR. BEKESHA: For processing FOIA, yes. A To clarify, S/ES-IRM does not conduct FOIA searches of PSTs. When S/ES -- when -- when the Office of Correspondence and Records or at this point the Office of the Secretariat staff needs to conduct a search of those electronic records, the secretariat staff contacts S/ES-IRM to make that PST available for searching. Q Okay. So the correspondence -- somebody within the Office of Correspondence and Records would actually conduct the search. A Correct. Q Okay. Thank you. During, more generally, between January 09 and March 2015, while the State Department was processing FOIA requests that may implicate Mrs. Clinton or Ms. Abedin's e-mail, did any State Department employees come across a non-State.gov e-mail account for Mrs. Clinton or Ms. Abedin? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: And that's just asking about processing of FOIA requests that implicate Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mails. MS. WOLVERTON: But there's no foundation for who you're talking about, whose e-mails, and that they had any tie to FOIA processing. Q While the State -- while the State Department was processing any of Ms. Abedin's e-mails in response to a FOIA request received between January 2009 and March 2015, did the State Department come across, see, a non-State.gov e-mail account for Ms. Abedin? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. Q You may answer. MS. WOLVERTON: And I instruct the witness not to answer. You can tailor it to the topic, which is request for -- FOIA requests for e-mails of former Secretary Clinton and Huma Abedin. Q Okay. While the State Department was processing FOIA -- FOIA requests that may implicate Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mails, did the State Department come across a non-State.gov e-mail account for Ms. Abedin? A Can you clarify "come across"? Q Within the records that were reviewed, was it -- did they -- did the State Department see the e-mail account, see an e-mail -- a non-State.gov e-mail address for Ms. Abedin? A I have no basis for responding to that question. Q Do you know who would have -- who would potentially know that information? A The question, as I understand it, doesn't -- doesn't make sense in the context of processing FOIA requests. If -- if a FOIA request -- if potentially responsive or responsive documents on a given subject were being reviewed, the -- the e-mail addresses that may be involved in those -- in those potentially responsive documents would not necessarily be an item of attention of the reviewer, unless that was the specific topic. Q But would a reviewer review the e-mail addresses on the page to ensure there was -- no redactions were necessary? A Yes. Q During that review process, did the State Department see a non-State.gov e-mail account for Ms. Abedin? A The way that IPS maintains its files, it's not possible to give a definitive answer to that question, because it would require looking in each individual FOIA response during that time frame and each individual document that was provided in response to a FOIA request to check for redactions. Q Would -A So I cannot -- I cannot definitively answer that question. Q Would Mr. Finney -- during Mrs. Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, for e-mail -- for FOIA requests that implicated Mrs. Clinton's e-mail and Ms. Abedin's e-mail, did Mr. Finney review responsive records that were located, or potentially responsive records that were located? A That were located where? Q Within the -- within the Office of the Executive Secretariat. A Yes. Q Did he review those -- would he have reviewed those e-mails in unredacted form? A Yes. Q Would Mr. Finney, therefore, know -- be aware of what he saw on the pages that he reviewed as response to those FOIA requests? A Not necessarily e-mail addresses. Q Would he -- to the extent he was reviewing those e-mail addresses for either responsiveness or for privilege claims, would he have looked at the e-mail addresses? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Lack of foundation, assumes facts not in evidence. Q You may answer the question. A The Office of Correspondence and Records, like other department bureaus and offices that -that conducts FOIA searches and produces potentially responsive documents, is not responsible for examining those documents for possible redactions or exemptions under the FOIA. That is a responsibility of IPS. Q Thank you for that. That helps clarify. So during -- while Mrs. Clinton was in office and a FOIA request was received that -- for records that may implicate Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mail, did anyone within IPS become aware of a non-State.gov e-mail account for Ms. Abedin while conducting the privilege or other review that you were just discussing? A It's not possible to definitively answer that question. Q Would it be possible by asking individual employees that reviewed -- reviewed records responsive to FOIA requests? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer that question. Q Is there one individual at IPS that would review nonredacted -- unredacted versions of records that were potentially responsive to FOIA requests sent during Mrs. Clinton's tenure that implicated Mrs. Clinton or Ms. Abedin's e-mails? A Is there one individual? Q One or two individuals. A No. There are multiple individuals. Q Do you know if any of those individuals saw either -- saw a non-State.gov e-mail account for Ms. Abedin? A It's not possible to definitively answer that question. Q Okay. Do you know if any of those individuals saw a non-State.gov e-mail account for Mrs. Clinton? A Again, it's not possible to definitively answer that question. Q Do you know if any of those individuals that reviewed the records discussed whether or not they -- whether they saw a non-State.gov e-mail account for Ms. Abedin or Ms. Mills? A No. Q Who did those individuals report to? A Which individuals? Q The ones that were reviewing unredacted versions of records for redactions. MS. WOLVERTON: You mean in IPS? MR. BEKESHA: In IPS, yes. A Would it be helpful to explain to you how a review for redactions works within IPS? Q That would be great. That probably would be the easiest way to get -- to get to my questions. Thank you. A When the case analyst in IPS receives back potentially responsive documents from the bureau or office that was tasked with conducting the search, as we discussed earlier, the case analyst goes through those potentially responsive documents to determine whether or not they are, in fact, responsive to the request that was received. After doing that review for responsiveness, the case analyst sends the documents to be scanned into IPS's electronic document management system. When that scanning process is done and those documents have been scanned and given a case identifying number electronically, then the analyst makes those files available to reviewers. Reviewers within IPS are retired foreign service officers who are hired to -- with specific subject-matter knowledge certified by various bureaus and offices to review subject matter that is specific to their area of experience. Those retired foreign service officers conduct what we call a two-level review, a line-by-line review of each -- each responsive document, to determine the releaseability under the FOIA, make redactions. The first -- the first of them conducts a review, and then the second of them conducts a supervisory review, a quality control check. Q And who do those foreign service officers, who do they directly report to? A Can we refer back to the organization chart? Q Absolutely. A So 7C. If you look in the Statutory Compliance and Research Division, they would -- they would be -- those retired foreign service officers are located throughout that division, working with the case analysts in those branches. Q Okay. Would the case analysts see the records with -- the unredacted versions of the records? A Yes. The case analyst receive the unredacted versions from the bureau or office that did the search. Q Okay. And then they would task those records out to the former foreign service officer, or retired foreign service officers, and then the records would be sent back to the case analyst? A Correct. Q When they were sent back were they in redacted or -- would they be in redacted or unredacted forms? A The redactions at that point would already have been done. In some cases the redactions may need to be consulted with the bureau that originated the documents. So the -- so the case analyst would then serve -- would sort of serve as a liaison to go back to the originating bureau or office for their concurrence on the redactions. Q Okay. Between January 2009 and March 15, did anyone within the -- within IPS, while responding to FOIA requests that may implicate Mrs. Clinton or Ms. Abedin's e-mails, become aware of the HDR22@Clintonemail.com e-mail address? A It's not possible for me to definitively answer that question. Q Okay. And would that be the same answer for the Huma@Clintonemail.com e-mail address? A Yes. Q Okay. MS. BERMAN: Can we take a short break? MR. BEKESHA: Sure. VIDEO SPECIALIST: This marks the end of Tape Number 3 in the deposition of Karin Lang. We are off the record at 12:19. (A recess was taken.) VIDEO SPECIALIST: Here begins Tape Number 4 in the deposition of Karin Lang. We are back on the record at 12:29. MR. BEKESHA: Great. Thank you. BY MR. BEKESHA: Q I -- I should just have a few more questions. You testified earlier that you recall or that you know of specific FOIA requests that were sent during Mrs. Clinton's tenure that implicated Mrs. Clinton -- that potentially implicated Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mail records. Which -- what -- what FOIA requests are those that you recall, that you know of? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. Q You may answer the question. A I can't recall any specific cases. Q So what -- did you have conversations with Mr. Finney or anyone else about specific FOIA requests that were received while Mrs. Clinton's -during Mrs. Clinton's tenure? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. Q You testified earlier that you were -- you are aware of specific FOIA requests that were sent after Mrs. Clinton left office that implicated Mrs. Clinton or Ms. Abedin's e-mails. What -- which -- what FOIA requests are you aware of? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. Also mischaracterizes former testimony. Q You may answer the question. A Can you clarify the time frame? Q The time frame of February 2013 to March 15. A Yes. Q What specific FOIA requests do -- do you know of? MS. WOLVERTON: Same objections. Q You may answer the question. A I'm not prepared to discuss specific cases. Q We discussed earlier Form DS-1748. On that form does it discuss use of personal e-mail for official government business? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence, lack of foundation. Q You may answer the question. MS. WOLVERTON: And the document speaks for itself. A I would have to refer to the document. Q Okay. Do you know, do you have a copy of that -- of a DS-1748 form with you today? A We do not. Q What is your -- what is your understanding of the DS-17 -- what is on the DS-1748 form? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The document speaks for itself. Q You may answer the question. A It's primarily to document the search that was conducted. It's an instruction from the IPS office, to the office that's been searched -- that's been tasked to do a search. And then it is the response from the office that has been tasked to do that search, documenting the search that it has conducted. Q What do you mean by "an instruction"? A It contains the information about the specific FOIA request, the subject, the keywords if there are any, the date ranges. Q You mentioned earlier that you had -- you spoke with Mr. Finney in preparation for today's deposition. Who else did you speak with? A A number of people, current and former employees of the State Department. Q Who are those individuals? You may answer the question. A We have a list prepared. Q Are there -- is there more than one copy of the list? MS. BERMAN: She can read it into the record. MR. BEKESHA: Okay. That -- that's fine. If you want to go ahead and read the list into the record. A Sure.

What did Cheryl Mills tell you? A Cheryl Mills met with counsel. Q And then counsel informed you what Ms. Mills said? A Yes. Q What did -- what did Ms. Mills tell counsel? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Lack of foundation. Q What -- what did counsel tell you that Ms. Mills told them? MS.

You mentioned that Ms. Mills was contacted and Ms. Mills or her representative had talked to counsel, talked to your counsel. So I'm wondering what did your -- what did counsel tell you about the conversations they had with Ms. Mills or Ms. Mills' representatives? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection to the extent that implicates attorney-client privileged communications. Maybe you can clarify the question. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. Q Did -- did counsel advise you of what Ms. Mills or Ms. Mills' representative told them? A Yes. Q What did Ms. Mills or her representatives tell them? You may answer the question. A Ms. Mills' representatives answered questions regarding the general policies and procedures for processing FOIA from her perspective during her time as an employee at the Department of State. Q Okay. Did you speak -- you said you spoke with Mr. Mull, Ambassador Mull, in preparation for today? A I did not speak personally with Ambassador Mull. Q Did counsel speak with Ambassador Mull in preparation for your testimony today? A Yes. Q What did Mr. Mull -- did -- did counsel tell you what Mr. Mull said in preparation for your deposition today? You may answer the question. A Yes. Q And what did counsel tell you that Mr. Mull said? MS. WOLVERTON: I'm going to object at this point to this line of questioning as improperly beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. You can ask her what information she has, but to go through all of the different people that she spoke with and get the specific facts from each person goes beyond the obligation of the 30(b)(6) witness. Q Did you speak with Mr. Lukens? A No, not personally. Q Did counsel -- do you know if counsel spoke to Mr. Lukens in preparation for your deposition today? A Yes. Q Did counsel tell you what Mr. Lukens told you, or told them? MS. WOLVERTON: Same objection. Instruct the witness not to answer. Q Are you choosing not to answer the question based on counsel's instructions? A Yes. Q Okay. You had a long list of people, and I don't want to go through all of those. Is there one individual that you spoke to more than the others in preparation for your testimony today? A No. Q You testified earlier that you spoke to Mr. Finney for approximately three -- a total of approximately three hours. Does that mean you talked to all of these witnesses for approximately three hours about your testimony today? A No. Q Did you speak to anybody more than three hours about your testimony today? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. This extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. Q Are you not answering the question based on advice -- instructions by counsel? A Yes. Q Did you speak to anybody more, for a longer period of time, than you spoke to Mr. Finney? MS. WOLVERTON: Same objection. Q You may answer the question. A Yes. Q Who was that? Who was that individual or individuals? You may answer the question. MS. WOLVERTON: Same objection. Q You may answer. A Eric Stein, Jonathon Wasser. Q Thank you. Who is Mr. Stein? A He is the acting co-Director of the IPS office. Q And when did he become acting co-Director? A I believe in March of this year. March or April of this year. Q Do you know what his -- was he with the State Department prior to that? A Yes. Q Where was -- what was his position? A He was an advisor to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for A/GIS that supervises the IPS office. Q Do you know how long he was in that position? A I do not. Q Okay. Is Jonathon Wasser still employed by the State Department? A Yes. Q Is he still within the office -- or I guess it's now the Division of Correspondence and Records? A Within the Executive Secretariat staff, yes. Q Has his position stayed the same since January 2009 to the present? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. MR. BEKESHA: Okay. Q What did -- what did Mr. Wasser tell you in preparation for today? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. Q You may answer the question. A The topic of the deposition is State Department practice for processing FOIA requests. Q But what -- what specifically did he tell you? MS. WOLVERTON: Same objection. Q You may answer the question. A About his -- his practice of processing FOIA requests. Q Did Mr. Wasser talk to you about Mrs. Clinton's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account? MS. WOLVERTON: Same objection. Q You may answer the question. A Can you be more specific? Q Sure. Did you and Mr. Wasser discuss Mrs. Clinton's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account? A Yes. Q What did he tell you? A This -- that non-State.gov e-mail account, which is now, as you know, available online for review by the public, searching that account in response to FOIA requests actually forms a significant part of Mr. Wasser's job. Q Did Mr. Wasser inform you of when he learned about Mrs. Clinton's non-State.gov e-mail account? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'm happy to have the witness, nevertheless, in the spirit of cooperation, answer a few questions to give you a context. But it's really not appropriate to go much further than that. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. Q You can answer the question. A He became aware of the possibly responsive documents contained in non-State.gov e-mail when Mrs. Clinton, former Secretary Clinton, returned those documents, turned those documents over to the State Department in December of 2014. Q Did Mr. Wasser inform you whether he knew of Mrs. Clinton's non-State.gov e-mail account prior to December 2014? MS. WOLVERTON: Same objection. Q You may answer the question. A Can you repeat the question? MR. BEKESHA: Could the court reporter repeat the question, please. (Pending question read.) A Yes. Q And when did he -- when did he say what -when he learned of her non-State.gov e-mail account? MS. WOLVERTON: Same objection. Q You may answer the question. A I think you're mischaracterizing my answer to the previous question. Q Could you repeat -- Mr. Wasser informed you that he knew of Mrs. Clinton's non-State.gov e-mail account prior to December 2014? A No. Q Okay. You also said that you talked -- that -did you reach out to Mr. Bentel? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Asked and answered. Also extends beyond the scope of the (b)(6) deposition topic -Q You may answer the question. MS. WOLVERTON: -- as noticed. Q You may answer the question. A Counsel did. MS. WOLVERTON: Could we go off the record? MR. BEKESHA: Sure. VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are going off the record. The time is 12:47. (A recess was taken.) VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are back on the record. The time is 1:09. MR. BEKESHA: Great. Thank you. Q What did Mr. Wasser tell you about his knowledge about the Clinton e-mail, the e-mail address that Mrs. Clinton used to conduct official government business? A Can you be more specific? Q Sure. During your preparations you said you talked with Mr. Wasser. During those discussions, what -- what did he tell you about his knowledge of Mrs. Clinton's non-State.gov e-mail account that she used for government business? A I don't recall specific discussions about his knowledge of that. Q Okay. I just want to clarify the list that you read off before. Of those, of the list, who did you not directly speak with? A You mean who did counsel speak with instead of me personally? Q Yes. That's correct. A Would you like me to read their names? Q Yes, please. A Okay. John Hackett, Margaret Grafeld, Patrick Kennedy, Stephen Mull, Lewis Lukens, Cheryl Mills, and the two at the end that counsel reached out to but were not able to connect with. Q Okay. Thank you. Did counsel provide you with notes or binders or materials based on their conversations with these individuals? A No. Q You just had discussions with counsel about what those individuals had told them? A Correct. Q Okay. With respect to Mr. Finney, in preparation for today did you and Mr. Finney talk about his knowledge about Mrs. Clinton's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business? A Yes. Q Did Mr. Finney -- what did Mr. Finney tell you about his knowledge? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Asked and answered. Q You may answer the question. A Can you be more specific? Q Sure. During -- during your conversations with Mr. Finney in preparation for today, you said that you discussed with Mr. Finney his knowledge about the Clinton -- Mrs. Clinton's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business. What did he tell you? MS. WOLVERTON: Same objection. Q You may answer the question. A Clarence Finney told me that he was not aware of former Secretary Clinton's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct government business throughout her tenure, nor for quite some time after her tenure. Q What words did he use to tell you that? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. Q You may answer the question. A I don't recall his specific words. Q Okay. Besides the binder that was introduced as Exhibit 2, what else -- what other documents did you review in preparation for today? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Asked and answered. Q You may answer the question. A Specific to this FOIA request, we reviewed a number of the e-mail communications for people involved in processing this FOIA request. Q What about for issues not specifically about this FOIA request? Did you review any records in preparation for today? A Yes. Q What were those records? A They included e-mail records of people relevant to this topic. Q What do you mean by that? A For example, some of the people who appear on this list, in addition to meeting with them, we reviewed their e-mail records on this topic. Q Do you recall whose e-mail records you reviewed? A I believe mostly, yes. Q Who were those individuals? Most of the people on the list, or you recall mostly -A I recall -- no, not most of the people on the list. Certain people on the list. Q Okay. Who were those individuals? A Clarence Finney, Jennifer Davis, Daniel Fogarty, Joseph Macmanus, Stephen Mull, Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin. Q And how did you get those e-mails that you reviewed? Did you ask these individuals directly for their e-mail records? A No. Q How did you get them? A Through the State Department, S/ES-IRM. Q Who -- who specifically provided you with those e-mails? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope of the obligation of the 30(b)(6) deponent. Q You may answer the question. MS. WOLVERTON: Instruct not to answer on that. Q For these e-mail records that you reviewed, what was the general time -- time period of these records? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Overly broad. Q What was the time period of Mr. Finney's records, e-mail records that you reviewed in preparation for today? A Approximately 2011 to the present. Q And approximately how many e-mail records did you review of his -- sorry. How many of his e-mail records did you review? A I'm sorry. I'm not able -- I can't recall that number. Q Do you know if they were a handful or hundreds of them? A Many of them, because his position is very closely related to this topic. Q In those e-mails from 2011 to 2013, did any of them refer to a personal e-mail address being used by Mrs. Clinton or Ms. Abedin to conduct official government business? A No. Q Do you know how many records of Joseph Macmanus you reviewed? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. Lack of foundation. Q You mentioned that you reviewed e-mail records of Mr. Macmanus in preparation for today? A Yes. Q How many record -- how many e-mail records of his did you review for today? A Not very many. Q Do you recall the time period of those e-mail records? A Yes. Q What was that? A The time period was when he was executive assistant to Secretary Clinton. Q And what time period? Do you recall that time period? Was it for her whole tenure or other tenures -- or, sorry, or just part of her tenure? A 2009 to 2011. Q In any of those e-mail records that you reviewed, did they identify -- did they contain the e-mail address HDR22@Clintonemail.com? A No. Q Did any of those records discuss Mrs. Clinton's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business? A No. Q Did you speak with Mr. Macmanus personally in preparation for today? A Yes. Q Did Mr. -- did you and Mr. Macmanus discuss his knowledge about Mrs. Clinton's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business? A No. We discussed the processing of FOIA requests. Q When did -- when did -- when did IPS -- I forgot the initials. When did IPS become aware of Mrs. Clinton's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope of the 30(b)(6) topic noticed. I'll instruct the witness not to answer that question. Q In the course of processing FOIA requests, did -- that implicated Ms. Clinton's or Ms. Abedin's e-mails, did IPS ever learn or become aware of Mrs. Clinton's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business? A Do you have a time frame for that question? Q We can break it down. How about between January 2009 and February 2013. A Can you ask the question again? MR. BEKESHA: Could you repeat the question, please. (Pending question read.) MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Vague. Q You may answer the question. A IPS is an office of three to four hundred people processing tens of thousands of FOIA requests per year. I don't think there is a way to answer that question definitively without speaking to all the current and former employees of IPS, which would be a very burdensome undertaking. Q What if we narrow my question to senior-level officials within IPS; does that -- is it easier to answer my question now? A What is the time frame for your question? Q During Mrs. Clinton's tenure. A To the best of my knowledge, no, they were not aware of use of such an e-mail account during her tenure. Q Do you know who would have -- who may know the answer to that question? A The Director of IPS from late in 2011 until early 2014 was Sheryl Walter. Q Between February 2013 and March 2015, do you know if senior-level officials within IPS, in the course of processing FOIA requests that may implicate Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin's e-mails, were aware of Mrs. Clinton's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business? A Yes. Q And when did they become aware of that information? A Department officials with responsibilities for federal recordkeeping began -- became aware and began to make inquiries about the use of non-State.gov e-mail to conduct government business over the summer of 2014. Q And how did they become aware of that? What happened in the summer of 2014 to make them aware of that? A During the course of reviewing document requests, people in the -- they became aware of these e-mails, these e-mail addresses. Q Do you know who those people were? A Not specifically. Q Okay. I'm going to ask the same questions about Mrs. -- Ms. Abedin's use of non-State.gov e-mail account. So first, with the caveats I stated before, for the time period between January 2009 and February 2013, was any senior-level officials with -- within IPS aware of Mrs. -- Ms. Abedin's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business? A No, I don't believe so. Q And what about the time period between February 2013 and March 2015? A Ms. Abedin had a State.gov e-mail address and conducted government business on that address. The awareness that there may be records outside of State.gov I believe emerged from a review of Secretary Clinton's e-mails. Q Do you know if anybody within IPS asked Ms. Abedin between January 2009 and February of 2013 whether she was using a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business along with her use of a State.gov e-mail account? A No. MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Overly broad. Q You may answer the question. A No. Q Do you know during -- during -- while Mrs. Clinton was in office, do you know if the Office of Legal Advisor was aware of Mrs. Clinton's use of a non-State.gov e-mail address to conduct official government business? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. I'll instruct the witness not to answer. Q In the office -- in the capacity of -- you testified earlier that the Office of Legal Advisor would be involved in FOIA -- in the processing of FOIA requests that were in litigation. During that process between -- while Mrs. Clinton was in office, was the Office of Legal Advisor aware that Mrs. Clinton was using a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for privileged attorney-client communications, as well as attorney work product protected information. And on that basis, I'll instruct the witness not to answer. Q Are you not answering the question based on instructions from counsel? A Yes. MR. BEKESHA: Can we take a short, -second break? MS. WOLVERTON: Okay. VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are going off the record. The time is 1:25. (A recess was taken.) VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are back on the record. The time is 1:56. MR. BEKESHA: Great. Thank you. BY MR. BEKESHA: Q Before we start -- I just have a few more questions. But can we mark the list of people discussed as Exhibit 3. MS. WOLVERTON: You can hand that to the court reporter, please. (Deposition Exhibit 3 marked for identification and is attached to the transcript.) Q Thank you. And just to be clear for the record, the list -- the exhibit that was just marked as Exhibit 3, is that the list you read from earlier? A Yes. Q Thank you. How did you create that list? A You mean, how did we decide who to talk to? Q Yes. A In discussions with counsel and colleagues in the department, we considered who would be knowledgeable on the topic of this deposition. Q Okay. In the course of representing the State Department in FOIA litigation that may have implicated Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Abedin's e-mails, when did the State Department inform the Department of Justice that Mrs. Clinton used a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic. Also implicates attorney-client privileged communications and attorney work product. On those grounds, I'll instruct the witness not to answer. MR. BEKESHA: The question was when the State Department as the client informed the attorney, not about the attorney's mental impressions or discussions that the attorney had with the State Department. MS. WOLVERTON: Still attorney-client communications. On that ground, I will invoke the privilege and instruct the witness not to answer. Q Are you choosing not to -MS. WOLVERTON: And also for the additional objections, it's beyond the scope of the noticed topic for 30(b)(6) deposition and implicates attorney work product. MR. BEKESHA: Okay. Q Are you not answering the question based on instructions of counsel? A Yes. Q And I'm going to ask the same question for when the State Department informed the Department of Justice about Ms. Abedin's use of a non-State.gov e-mail account to conduct official government business. MS. WOLVERTON: And I'll object on the same grounds, specifically that the question exceeds the scope of the notice 30(b)(6) deposition topic, calls for attorney-client communications which are privileged, as well as protected work -- attorney work product. And on those grounds I will instruct the witness not to answer. Q And are you not answering the question because -- based on instructions of your attorney? A Yes. Q Okay. Does the State Department know if Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin has returned all potentially responsive records that are potentially responsive to the FOIA request at issue in this case? A Can you repeat the question? Q Sure. Does the State Department know if Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin has returned to the State Department all records that may be potentially responsive to the FOIA request at issue in this case? A The State Department's only basis for -for judging whether or not they've returned all potentially responsive records would be their statements on that subject. Q And has Mrs. Clinton told the Department of State that she has returned all potentially responsive records -- sorry, all records that are potentially responsive to the FOIA request at issue in this case? A I believe Mrs. -- former Secretary Clinton has told the State Department that she's returned all official -- government business records that she had in her possession and control to return. Q Has the State Department specifically asked Mrs. Clinton to return any records that are potentially responsive to the FOIA request at issue in this case? A No. Q Has the State Department -- does the State Department know if Ms. Abedin has turned over all records that are potentially responsive to the FOIA requests that are at issue in this case? A Again, the State Department's basis for knowing that would be Ms. Abedin's statements regarding the records that she's turned over. Q Has the State Department asked Ms. Abedin if she has turned over all records potentially responsive to the FOIA request at issue in this case? A Has the State Department specifically asked that? Q Yes. A Not to my knowledge. Q Okay. MR. BEKESHA: We have no further questions. MS. WOLVERTON: Can we take a short break? Promise it will be short. VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are going off the record. The time is 2:01. (A recess was taken.) VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are back on the record. The time is 2:10. EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT BY MS. WOLVERTON: Q Okay. Ms. Lang, I'll ask the court reporter if she could read back the second to the last question that you were asked on direct, please. (The reporter read the record as follows: "Has the State Department asked Ms. Abedin if she has turned over all records potentially responsive to the FOIA request at issue in this case?") Q And, Ms. Lang, would you like to add to or make any modifications to the answer that you gave on direct? A Yes. Q Please do. A In -- can I introduce an exhibit? Q Yes. MS. WOLVERTON: Let's mark this as Exhibit , please. (Deposition Exhibit 4 marked for identification and is attached to the transcript.) Q And can you identify what this document is? A Yes. This is the defendant's status report in this case that was filed on August 7, 15. Q So it was filed in this case. MS. WOLVERTON: For your information. MR. BEKESHA: Okay. A The referenced document contains a letter from the State Department to Ms. Abedin's legal counsel, dated August 5th, 2015, asking her to -to -- specifically asking her for documents responsive to this case. MS. WOLVERTON: And could I ask the court reporter to read back the last question on direct and the answer. (The reporter read the record as follows: "QUESTION: Has the State Department asked Ms. Abedin if she has turned over all records potentially responsive to the FOIA request at issue in this case? "ANSWER: Has the State Department specifically asked that? "QUESTION: Yes. "ANSWER: Not to my knowledge.") Q And, Ms. Lang, do you have anything further to say in response to that question? Do you have anything further after she read both of those questions? A As I just noted, the -- the letter dated August 5th, 2015, from the State Department was directed to Ms. Abedin's counsel to ask this question, ask that she turn over any documents responsive to this case. A separate letter, also dated August 5th, 15, was directed to former Secretary Clinton's counsel, asking her specifically again to turn over any documents related to this case, responsive to this case. MS. WOLVERTON: And can I ask the court reporter to read the fourth to the last question on the direct exam. Maybe the third and fourth. (The reporter read the record as follows: QUESTION: Has the State Department specifically asked Mrs. Clinton to return any records that are potentially responsive to the FOIA request at issue in this case? "ANSWER: No. "QUESTION: Has the State Department -4 does the State Department know if Ms. Abedin has turned over all records that are potentially responsive to the FOIA requests that are at issue in this case?") Q With respect to the first question that the court reporter just asked -- or read back as to Mrs. Clinton, and you answered no to that question, do you now wish to add to or modify that answer? A Yes. Q Could you please do so. A As noted in the court filing, the defendant's status report filed on August 7th, 2015, one of the letters attached dated August 5th, 2015, is a letter to former Secretary Clinton's counsel asking that she turn over any documents potentially responsive to this FOIA case. Q Thank you. A Or -- can -- I'm sorry. Can I add to that? Q Go ahead. Yes. A Or if she had, in fact, already turned them over to -- to confirm under penalty of perjury that she had done so. Q Thank you. And, Ms. Lang, you were also asked on direct whether anyone who worked for Mr. Clarence Finney asked S/ES-IRM about whether former Secretary Clinton used e-mail, whether anybody asked that question when Ms. Clinton was in office. And do you have any further information in response to that question as you sit here now? A Yes. Q Could you please tell us. A I spoke to Clarence Finney on the break, and he advised that he did not believe anyone who worked for him had conversations about that topic with S/ES-IRM during that time period. Q And did Mr. Finney also provide any information as to whether anyone who worked for him asked him whether former Secretary Clinton used e-mail during the time of her tenure? A Yes. He provided information on this. Q And what information did he provide? A He advised that they did not. Q Also on the direct examination, Ms. Lang, you were asked about, when the FOIA request in this case, at issue in this case, was reopened in March of 2015, who decided to task the Under Secretary of Management with a search. Do you recall that question? A Yes. Q And would you like to provide any further information in answer to it now? A Yes. Q Please do. A Based on a conversation just now with Susan Weetman and Julia Navarro from IPS, Appeals and Litigation branch, the decision to task the Under Secretary for Management's office for additional possible responsive records was made by Susan Weetman, then the branch chief of Appeals and Litigation, upon the advice of the Office of the Legal Advisor, based on a review of documents that had already been produced in the case. MS. WOLVERTON: Thank you. No further questions. MR. BEKESHA: I just have I think very few questions. EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF BY MR. BEKESHA: Q You just testified about the August 5th, 15, letters that were sent to Ms. Abedin and to Mrs. Clinton, or representatives of them. Did the State Department receive responses to those letters? A Yes. Q In those responses did Mrs. Clinton inform the State Department that she has turned over all records potentially responsive to plaintiff's FOIA request? A Yes. Q What was marked as -- what exhibit was that marked as? I'm sorry. A Exhibit 4. Q That was Exhibit 4? What was marked as Exhibit 4 is the August , 2015, declaration of John Hackett. Is that correct? A Yes. I'm sorry, I don't think the declaration from Secretary Clinton is contained in this packet. Q Okay. If you can look at Paragraph 14 of Mr. Hackett's declaration. It states, "By letter dated August" -MS. WOLVERTON: Wait. Hold on a second. Which? A I'm sorry. MS. WOLVERTON: Which declaration? Q Exhibit 4. Isn't that what was -MS. WOLVERTON: That's a status report, Exhibit 4. I'm sorry. Would you like to take a look at it? MR. BEKESHA: Wasn't the declaration attached to that? MS. BERMAN: Not in that one. MR. BEKESHA: Oh. Yeah, this was the earlier. Okay. BY MR. BEKESHA: Q When did Mrs. Clinton or Mrs. Clinton's attorney respond to the August 5th letter that you discussed, testified to shortly? MS. WOLVERTON: I will note that that has been filed in the case and is a matter of the record. MR. BEKESHA: Okay. Q In -- on August 14, 2015, Mr. Hackett filed a declaration in this case that stated, "By letter dated August 12th, 2015, former Secretary Clinton's attorney informed the department that he provided to the Department of Justice on August 6, 15, the PST file containing electronic copies of the 55,000 pages of e-mails on a thumb drive along with two copies." MS. WOLVERTON: Can I ask where you're reading? MS. BERMAN: That might be in her binder. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. A Page 6 of -MR. BEKESHA: Page 6, Paragraph 14 of John Hackett's declaration of August 14th, 2015. It's Document Number 26-1. This is the ECF document number. MS. BERMAN: I'm sorry. So which paragraph? Can you just -MR. BEKESHA: Sure. Paragraph 14. THE WITNESS: That's 3B. MS. WOLVERTON: Thank you. Sorry. Sorry. MR. BEKESHA: I was just going to identify for the record which tab, where it is in Exhibit 2. BY MR. BEKESHA: Q Could you identify where this letter is in Exhibit 2? A 3B. Q Okay. MS. WOLVERTON: I'm going to object to the line of questioning about this paragraph, based on the order entered on May 4th that specifically excludes from discovery information that concerns pending FBI or law-enforcement investigations, and on that basis instruct the witness not to answer questions about that paragraph. MR. BEKESHA: Okay. Q When did Mrs. Clinton or her representatives respond to the August 5th, 2015, letter? MS. WOLVERTON: Again, that's been filed in the case. Do you have -- do you happen to have the declaration with you to facilitate the answer to that? MR. BEKESHA: I don't know. I don't know if it is in the record in the case. MS. WOLVERTON: The declaration? The declaration from former Secretary Clinton was filed. MS. BERMAN: It's dated August 8th. Q So is it the witness's testimony that the declaration was the response to the August 5th, 15, letter? Or is that -- yeah, strike that. MS. WOLVERTON: If you wanted to ask that question -MR. BEKESHA: No. I asked the question is -Q I'm asking -- I asked if the State Department received a response to the August 5th, 2015, letter. And I'm asking what was the response. MS. WOLVERTON: Can we take a break? We will try to find that information. MR. BEKESHA: If it's very short, that will be great. MS. WOLVERTON: Well, it depends. There's a lot of papers filed in the case. We'll have to find it. It has been filed in the case. MR. BEKESHA: Sure. VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are going off the record. The time is 2:24. (A recess was taken.) VIDEO SPECIALIST: We are back on the record. The time is 2:32. BY MR. BEKESHA: Q Okay. MS. WOLVERTON: Before you ask your next question, Ms. Lang, would you like to clarify or add to your last response? THE WITNESS: Yes. I have here two documents. MS. WOLVERTON: Why don't we mark this as Exhibit 5. (Deposition Exhibit 5 marked for identification and is attached to the transcript.) MR. BEKESHA: Can I just take a look at it. MS. WOLVERTON: Of course. MS. BERMAN: Sorry we don't have copies. A To amend my answer to the previous question, from the defendant's status report filed on the 7th of August, 2015, Paragraph 2 reads, "The department has also complied with subparts 2 and 3 of the court's order. On August 5th, 2015, the department wrote to the former Secretary, Ms. Abedin, and Ms. Mills, requesting that these individuals provide it with the information that the court ordered it to request regarding federal records in their possession. Copies of these letters are attached." And then in the supplement to defendant's -MS. WOLVERTON: Sorry. I think there's another carry over on the next page. A I was just going to read the key part, but I'll read the whole paragraph. "Copies of these letters are attached hereto as Exhibits B, C, and D. On August 6, 2015, counsel for Ms. Abedin responded to the department's request for federal records in her possession. A copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit E. On August 6, 2015, counsel for Ms. Mills responded to the department's August 5th letter. A copy of that letter is attached hereto as Exhibit F. The department has not yet received a response to its letter from the former Secretary." Turning to Exhibit 5, which is a supplement to the defendant's August 7th, 2015, status report, filed on August 10, 2015. It reads, "This is to supplement Paragraph 2 of the August 7, 15, status report filed by the U.S. Department of State. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a declaration dated August 8, 2015, from former Secretary Clinton." Q Okay. Thank you. Can I see Exhibit 4. Okay. In Paragraph 2 it states, "On August 5, 2015, the department wrote to former Secretary, Ms. Abedin and Ms. Mills requesting that these individuals provide it with the information that the court ordered it to request regarding federal records in their -- in their possession." In the August 5th letters, did the State Department specifically ask those individuals if they have returned all records potentially responsive to this specific FOIA request? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The documents speak for themselves. Q You may answer the question. A May I see the exhibit? Reading from Exhibit 4, the letter dated August 5th, 2015, from the State Department, Under Secretary of State for Management, to counsel for former Secretary Clinton. "As you know, the department requested that your client, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, provide it with any federal records in her possession, such as an e-mail sent or received on a personal e-mail account while serving as Secretary of State if there is reason to believe that it may not otherwise be preserved in the department's recordkeeping system. "Your client has produced approximately ,000 pages of documents in response. I am writing to you now regarding additional requests the Department has been ordered to make of your client in a Freedom for Information Act, FOIA Case Judicial Watch versus Department of State, DDC Number -CV-1363. "On July 31st, 2015, the United States District Court in the Judicial Watch case ordered the Department to make two requests of your client related to the FOIA requests at issue in that case. Those FOIA requests seek the following information: Any and all SS 50 notification of" personnel -"personnel action forms for Abedin, any and all contracts including but not limited to personal service contracts between the Department of State and Ms. Abedin, and any and all records regarding, concerning or related to the authorization for Ms. Abedin to represent individual clients and/or otherwise engaged in outside employment while employed by and/or engaged in a contractual arrangement with the Department of State. "Pursuant to the court's order, a copy of which is attached, the department requests that your client confirm under penalty of perjury that she has produced all responsive information that was or is in her possession as a result of her employment at the State Department. "If all such information has not yet been produced, please produce the information forthwith and describe under penalty of perjury the extent to which" -- Ms. Mills and -- "Ms. Abedin and Ms. Mills used Mrs. Clinton's e-mail server to conduct official government business. "In the event you have questions regarding the transfer of records to the department, please contact the agency records officer William Fischer at 202-261-8369. In the meantime, I would appreciate it if you would confirm receipt of this letter and respond to the above request for information in writing as soon as possible." And it is signed by Under Secretary Pat Kennedy. Q Thank you. So is it fair to say that the State Department asked Mrs. Clinton or her representatives to confirm that all records potentially responsive to this FOIA request, confirm that she had returned all records potentially responsive to this FOIA request? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The document speaks for itself. Q You may answer the question. A The document speaks for itself. Q Okay. Did Mrs. Clinton respond -- did Mrs. Clinton confirm for the State Department that she produced all records potentially responsive to this FOIA request? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The document provided by Ms. Clinton speaks for itself. Q You may answer the question. A The document speaks for itself. Q When you read the document -- as the document sits in front of you, does the document state -- do you believe the document states that Mrs. Clinton returned all records potentially responsive to this FOIA request? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The document speaks for itself, and calls for a legal conclusion. Q You may answer the question. A I am not a lawyer, and I'm not qualified to make a legal conclusion. Q Does the State Department believe that Mrs. Clinton confirmed that all records responsive -- that are potentially responsive to this FOIA request have been returned to the State Department? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Calls for a legal conclusion. Q You may answer the question. A I'm not an attorney. I can't make a legal conclusion. Q Sure. The question didn't ask for a legal conclusion. Does the State Department believe that Mrs. Clinton confirmed that she returned all responsive records -- all records potentially responsive to the FOIA requests in this case? You may answer the question. MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The document speaks for itself. Q You can answer the question. A I have nothing to add. Q A similar e-mail -- similar letter from Under Secretary -- you testified that a similar letter was sent by Under Secretary Pat Kennedy to Ms. Abedin. Does Ms. Abedin in response to that letter confirm that she returned all potentially responsive records -- all records to the State Department that are potentially responsive to the FOIA request at issue in this case? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. The document speaks for itself. Q You can answer the question. A I have nothing to add to the document. Q What document are you referring to? A At the time the letter was sent on August th, the response on August 6th that was attached to this court filing was a partial response, because at that time Ms. Abedin was still producing documents and returning them to the State Department. Q Okay. Has Ms. -- has Ms. Abedin finished producing records to the State Department? MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Extends beyond the scope of the 30(b)(6) topic noticed for deposition. On that basis I'll instruct the witness not to answer. Q Has Ms. Abedin informed the State Department that she has returned all records potentially responsive to the FOIA request at issue in this case? You can answer the question. MS. WOLVERTON: Objection to the extent the document speaks for itself. MR. BEKESHA: What document are you referring to? The witness just said the document was -- the document she's referring to was sent earlier and there were subsequent documents. So what document are you referring to? MS. WOLVERTON: The documents that comprise the record of the case. If you want, we can take another break and go find them or -MR. BEKESHA: Sure. MS. BERMAN: Why don't we go off the record.
