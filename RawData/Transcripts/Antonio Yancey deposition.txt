EXAMINATIONBY MR. ELLISON: Q What I'm going -- today we're doing your deposition. Have you ever done a deposition before? A. I have. Q. You have. Okay. All right. Just know as a matter of practice that I'm a little more nonspecific than I sometimes try to be, so if my question is not clear in any way, you're not going to insult me or otherwise upset me in any way if you say, "Phil, that doesn't make sense. Can you ask it another way?" or "Try again." Okay? So feel free to jump in if it doesn't make sense, all right? A. Okay. Q. What I'm going to do today, do you have access -- I mean, I can see you on the screen right now. I'm going to show some documents on a computer screen. Do you have the ability to see those? I know I see a light that's pretty bright behind you there, but can you see the screen okay if I were to share a document? A. Yeah, I see them. Q. Okay. Fair enough. I don't need you to adjust, as long as you can see it. You're a little more of an outline because you're real bright behind you, but that's fine for me so it doesn't matter for me. MR. KENNEDY: You've got a halo, Doctor. THE WITNESS: I was just thinking that. MR. ELLISON: Well, it's better than my horns that usually show up behind me here. THE WITNESS: Right, right. Q. Anyway, all right. Well, let's get started here then. Just for the record you are Dr. Antonio Yancey, correct? A. Correct. Q. All right. And you are -- and I'm just -- to make this quick, you're the director of the Michigan Neonatal Biobank, correct? A. Correct. Q. All right. How long have you served in that role as a director of the Biobank? A Since April of 2017. Q And what does that role consist of? A So I'm pretty much the -- I mean, I'm the director, so I'm responsible for the overall operations of the Biobank. I'm responsible for all of the financials for the Biobank, just pretty much what a typical director would do, just oversee operations and the finance. That includes logistical stuff in terms of building -- the building and assets that are in the lab, just typical things that a director would do. Q Sure. So you would be -- not to put words in your mouth, but you would be in charge of all of the personnel and equipment, and assets of the Biobank? A That's correct. Q All right. And as I understand it also, you serve in administration at Wayne State University as well? A Right. So I'm the associate vice president for research operations for Wayne State University. I'm actually a Wayne State University employee. I'm not employed by the Biobank and one of my responsibilities as the associate vice president for the Biobank -- I mean as the director, sorry 21 -Q Take your time. Take your time. Not a problem. A Yeah. One of my responsibilities as the associate vice president of research operations is to manage the Biobank. Q Okay. Do you get any compensation from the Biobank as part of your duties? A I do not. Q All right. Let me ask it this way: If you were to take a new position or retire today or decide, "I no longer want to be here in the lovely State of Michigan anymore" and you go somewhere else, the person it that would assume your role at Wayne State University would also assume the directorship of the Biobank? A That is correct. So there was a predecessor that worked for -- prior to me taking over, I think for at least the last ten years. This has always been set up that way here the individual that's managing the Biobank, they also have other responsibilities within a division of research, and it just varies on the position itself but again, I was put into the position in 2017 when my predecessor left the University. Q As part of this -- as part of your role with the Biobank, I've come to learn and maybe you can confirm for me that you're part of a board of directors with the Biobank, correct? A That's correct. Q All right. Just so we're clear for the record today, when I reference the Biobank, that's the shorthand version of what I'm referring to as the Michigan Neonatal Biobank, Inc. Fair enough? A That's correct. Q All right. I'm going to share my -- we're going to see if this works right now. I'm going to try to share my screen and we'll see if I can make this -- okay. Can you see on the screen right? You can see, well, your picture right there? A It's me. Q All right. Fantastic. This is a -- I'm just going to represent --A That's when I was younger. Q Well, I always joke I like the younger pictures of me. There's less facial real estate, as I tell people, right? So we all look better yesteryear, but let's blame COVID. We'll blame COVID for all of that, right? A. Right, right. Q Anyway, what I've been presented, just for the record, that this is what I presented to the witness as Exhibit M for purposes of this deposition. (Deposition Exhibit M marked) Q. Doctor, this is a -- and I'm just going to represent to you this is a printout of the board of directors page of the Michigan -- of the Biobank website. I see -- I'm going to present to you there's four -- excuse me. There's six photographs with six people identified. Are those the current members of the board of directors for the Biobank? A. That's correct. Q. All right. Do you know how they got their roles with the Biobank as on the board of directors? A. I do not. Q. I noticed looking at the sheet here with the six of you that you're the only one that's got the word "director" underneath that. What distinguishes you as a director versus the other five that are there in that capacity? A. So again, I'm the actual director of the Biobank, and so pretty much, again, I'm over -- I see over -- I see the operations for the Biobank, but I also have an appointment on the board too, and the rest of these individuals are strictly board members, so they don't have anything to do with the day-to-day operations where I do. Q Again, not to put words in your mouth, but you'd be like the manager, but you also have a participation on the board of directors as well, correct? A Correct. I'm the director of the Biobank, correct. Q Well, let me ask it this way: When there's a board meeting of the board of directors for the Biobank, you would participate in that board of directors meeting, correct? A That would be correct. Q All right. Do you have a vote? Well, let me lay a foundation. Does the board of directors vote on matters of Biobank concerns? A Yeah. They -- we do. I mean, it's more like -- pretty much -- it's not anything formal, think. It's more discussion and collaborations with conversations and decisions of that sort, but I guess the answer would be yes. Q I'm going to ask it this way: I mean, one of the things -5 my wife -- my wife is a school board president, right? So, you know, there is not, as you can imagine, a lot of hotly contested -- you know, like the Supreme Court is a 5-4 decision. Those thins are done by discussion. They reach a consensus at these board meetings, so long as there's no dissent. Is that -- would that be a fair characterization of how this board operates? A Correct. Q All right. And you would be a person that would participate and would try to reach a consensus with the other five members of the board for issues that come up that go before the board of directors? A No, that's not correct. Q That's not correct? Okay. A. I don't have -- yeah. I'm the secretary of the board, so my job pretty much is to facilitate the agendas and, you know, kind of organize the meetings, but I don't have a decision in any of the discussions at all. Q Okay. All right. Fair enough. And that's why we get these depositions, I get to learn such things. Okay. I guess what I want to start with -- I'm going to turn that -- let's see here. Just to be clear, is there -- other than these six -- well, you identified the five board members plus you as the director. Is there anybody else that's involved with the board of directors for the Biobank? A In terms of board of directors? Q Yes. A No. Q I'm just going to leave -- I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm just going to leave that there, see if that works. Nope. I did that wrong. All right. So we'll jump back and forth a little bit here. A Okay. Q This is the new world order. I've done exactly three depositions by Zoom. We don't normally -- we always usually do these in person with printouts in front of everybody. What I want to kind of understand that you can help educate me and ultimately, through this deposition, the Court, is what is the nature of the role of the Biobank vis-a-vis Can you explain that? A Yeah. So the Biobank really in simple terms, is that we're just a depository, a storage area, so our job is to strictly store the blood spots. That's what we do. Q Okay. Well, what's -- now you guys are formulated as an independent -- legally -- I guess legally independent nonprofit corporation, correct? A Correct. We are a 501(c). Q. Okay. And hence why you have a board of directors? A. Correct. Q. Right. Let me ask this: Let's just pretend for the sake of argument that my son was born three years ago. His -- we'll get into how blood gets in in just a minute, but let's just assume for the sake of discussion that his blood spot is in your Biobank, okay? Can I just come to you guys and say, "Give me his blood sample back"? A. No, you cannot. Q. Okay. That's what I want to understand. What role dodoes the Biobank fulfill or operate under as it connects to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services? A Okay. So our job is merely -- I'm going to probably say the word "storage" a lot, because that's what we are. Q Fair enough. A So basically, our relationship with the State is that we're basically just a storage facility, so what happens is is that any residual blood spots that are left from testing at the State lab, those are basically sent to the Biobank, to the operations that I manage, and then our job is to get those blood spots and we basically store them in our storage facility. That's pretty much what we do, so when those blood spots come, they come from the -- Lansing sends them to the State of Michigan building on West Grand Boulevard, which is walking distance from our facility. We have an employed that picks up those and they're called the residuals, just leftover again from the State. My team picks up those blood spots and what we do is we catalog them into a system and then eventually from that system it goes into a storage facility that's temperature controlled. And so, we have no idea, you know, who the blood spots are. They come with us with I believe it's an eight-digit number, what's called like a -- it's an association with a Julian date, but there is no -- there is no information on that and our job is basically to store them in numerical order in terms of the Julian date and they go into our storage facility, so that's what we do. Q Okay. Let me ask this then. Why, if you know -- and, again I should be clear. I know you've done a deposition before. If you don't know the answer to a question, it's perfectly fine to tell me you don't know. A Okay. Q Do you know why you -- why the Biobank is structured as a nonprofit rather than simply the Department of Health and Human Services just simply having a cooler themselves or renting a facility themselves? Why do we need the Biobank? A I have no idea. That was probably way before my time. I never -- I don't know the answer to that. Q Okay. Now, in your role as director of the Biobank, I know one of the allegations in this complaint that I've made against you is that you're acting either in concert with or are a state actor. I guess what I'm trying to understand is who -- I mean, you've talked about your board of directors this morning. Who is in charge over you in terms of the Biobank? A So I report -- well, I report to the -- it's kind of the way it's structured, because I'm a Wayne State employee I report to the vice president of research for Wayne State University. That's who I report to in terms of Wayne State. But then I also report to the board as a whole. So I have two -- you know, basically two supervisors, if you would, but primarily all of my evaluations, my performance is all done by the vice president for research for Wayne State University. There is no input or anything that goes to the VP of research in terms of my performance, so I really kind of really see myself I guess technically reporting to the vice president for research. Q When you say research, that would be at Wayne State University, correct? A. That is correct. Q. One of the things -- let me just say I'm sympathetic to what you're trying to articulate because I've been trying to sort out the legal structure of how things fit together, and just my statement, not whether you agree with it, but it's complicated. A Right. Q Let me ask this question: One of the things that I've been trying to figure out is as I started -- kind of the top of this line of questions is assume I have my son's -- my son's blood sample is in your guys' Biobank, right? It's in one of the cards and as I've nicknamed them in my mind, the coolers, right? Temperature-controlled facilities, fair? A Right. Q Okay. And just let me tell you, I'm going to use probably the wrong words too when it comes to -- I'm not a science person, so if you need to correct me -A Right. Q -- please feel free. A. Okay. Q So I imagine these blood samples on these Guthrie cards that have been cut up into squares are in a cooler; would that be fair? A. Yes, it's fair. Q. Okay. And they're --A. Some are in -- let me clarify that. There are some that are in a cooler and some that are not in a cooler. Q. Okay. A. So some --Q. Let's get that -- I was going to ask about that, so let's get that one out of the way. Why are some of these in coolers and why are some of them at ambient temperatures? A So at some point -- and I can't -- this is before my time. I can just kind of tell you a little bit of what I've learned from different people. At one point the State had made a decision to refrigerate the blood spots in order to basically -- and basically to -- what word am I looking for? To keep the spots more viable, I guess, in terms of potential research. So what happens is typically -- someone made a decision and I guess there's research and literature out there regarding this, that if you refrigerate the blood spots, basically the integrity of them are basically protected for a longer period of time, so that's all that means. At some point the State made a decision based on research that's out there in the research world that if you refrigerate these blood spots, then they'll last longer. The integrity, you know, and all those kinds of things are more viable or more from a liability perspective you can trust them, I guess, in terms of -- you can trust them more in terms of whatever research you're doing, so just the viability of the blood spot itself; it's supposed to last longer. Q Okay. A So they did that -- and I believe it's -- I can just tell you from -- I believe it's 2000 and -- I want to say for the last -- we've had them about eight years. No, we had them from 2008 to current that are refrigerated in our Biobank. Q Okay. And when we talk about the ones before 2008, those would be just stored at normal ambient everyday room temperature, fair? A That's fair. Q Okay. However, would you agree that both pre-2008 ambient temperature spots, stores spots, and post-2008 refrigerated spots are both spots that have been made available for access for researchers or for the punches that are sought by researchers out in the public? A That's correct. Q All right. Let me ask this. I mean, I kind of skipped over and jumped ahead a little bit. What is your background in terms of scientific understanding? I mean, you're a doctor. I know you're Dr. Yancey. I've seen that on there. A Right. Q What is your background? What's your educational background and field of study. A So I'm not a scientist at all. I have a doctorate in organizational leadership, so basically my doctorate is all business-related. I do nothing with science at all in no capacity. Q So you're about like me. The extent of our knowledge is Band-Aids and Robitussin, you know? A There you go. There you go. Q All right. So good. We can speak on non-scientific terms going forward. A Yes. Q All right. The question you mentioned earlier that the State decided to, you know, for example, separate out refrigerated after 2008 and non-refrigerated ambient before that. What role does the State have in making such a decision like that as it applies to the Biobank? A What decision that they have? Q What I guess I'm trying to understand -- forgive me. I'm going to be a little long-winded here with this. What I'm trying to understand is the Biobank is a separate legal entity as a nonprofit. A Right. Q That's my representation to you. I think you even answered that earlier. A Right. Q But a lot of -- I see in the discovery that's been provided by the State and by Mr. Kennedy, who is your attorney, is that the State seems to be calling the shots. State officials over at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services are calling the shots and making decisions about the use, storage, availability of spots, access to spots, and that the Biobank folks are following or otherwise agreeing to that process. A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q Make me understand what the role is between -- again, let me start off -- let me strike that and start off by saying am I wrong, and then follow up by explain to me how can you -6 how can you explain to me and vis-a-vis the judge what the nature of the relationship is between the state officials at the Department of Health and Human Services as it applies to all of these activities going on at the Biobank? A So the Biobank deposits -- or I guess there's two components from my perspective. One is that yes, you do have the State that is involved in all of the IRB approvals, all of the operation process, and so they're making those decisions at the state level. And then they've contracted us to basically be the bio depository just in terms of the storage, and so, I mean, to answer your question, yes, the State does make some calls, but primarily they don't make any calls regarding the depository bank within itself. That is a call that's made by the board, which as you can see is a collaboration. We have a person from the State, and then all of our other partners from the other universities that sit on this board, so it's fair to say that with some processes the State are making the call, but when it comes to the bio depository within itself, the storage facility, they're not really making the call for that. That would be the board that's making the ultimate calls for that piece. So there are so many components before it gets to us, and that's when the State gets the lead on those components. Q And to be fair, when the board makes a decision, you as a role of the director, effectuate those decisions and whatever those decisions may be? A That would be correct, yes. Q So say, for example, going back to the example I was starting with with my son, and this is again just as a reference point for me. My son has got some blood samples, some dry blood spots in the Biobank right now. Let's say I wanted to get those -- I wanted to get those spots removed from the Biobank and I no longer wanted you to have access to them. Could I come to you, first of all, and say, "Please remove those spots"? A No, absolutely not. Q Why not? A Because I wouldn't even know how to identify your son's spots because there would be no -- there are no names that are associated with it, so I wouldn't even know, you know, where to go, where to pull it, what shelf it's on. I wouldn't have any of that information. Q Okay. Let me play another what-if. A. Okay. Q. Pretend I came -- for whatever reason I came to you with the -- I call them -- I've seen them referenced in there, called ascension numbers? Is that fair? A. Yes. Q. Okay. I come to you with my son's ascension numbers and I say, "I would like" -- "These are my son's ascension numbers which identify the specific blood spot wherever it's stored in the facility. Go get those. I want those and I want to take them with me when I come to see you at your office at TechTown," right? Can I do that with you? A You cannot. Q Okay. Explain to me why not that in that sense. A Because our job is primarily -- we deal strictly with researchers. We don't have any contact with any of the general public in reference to pulling blood spots. It would have to go through the State, and then the State would communicate to me to pull a particular blood spot from the bank. We don't interact with the general public. We only interact with researches only when we've been given approval by the State of Michigan to interact with the researcher, but we definitely never, ever deal with the general public non-researchers. Q Okay. We're going to get into that in a little more detail in a couple minutes. A Okay. Q But let me ask this question: As you get talking about -you know, let's focus on the example with my son, for example. A Okay. Q I want to be able to get his sample removed from the Biobank, okay? A Okay. Q. How can I go about doing that? A. You would have to contact the State of Michigan to request that they be pulled. Q So if the State of Michigan provided you with direction that said, "Hey, here is Phil Ellison's son's number. Go pull that one and we either want to destroy or otherwise give that sample back," you would act in accordance with that directive? A That would be correct. Q All right. And let's go the other way around. Let's pretend my second son is born, and the State hands off a sample to you and says, "Store this in the Biobank," you're working in agreement in concert with them to put it into the Biobank at the State's direction, fair? A I need you to repeat that question one more time. Q Sure; sure. So I was just talking about my first son. A Right. Q And we're talking about taking a sample out, so I have a second son. A Okay. Q And he's born today, right? Thank goodness I've only got one, but let's just say I have a second son, right? A Okay. Q His sample is taken. The State newborn screening program does the testing on it. They send that sample over to you and they say, "File this into the cooler." A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q Right? A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q I mean, you would be acting in accordance and in joint concert with them to put that material into the storage facility for long-term storage like all the other samples? A That's correct. Q Do you have any discretion or any option to say, "I'm not going to," -- as the director to say, "I'm not going to have certain samples come into my facility"? A No. Q Would there be any reason why you would deny storing samples? A No, not really. The only thing I can of that -- and this is not an issue today, but at some point there could be an issue of capacity, room capacity. Q Well, we're not at that point today, are we? A No. Q All right. Fair enough. Does the board of directors have any say on whether a sample is pulled for destruction or added, and the same example of son one and son two I've just been giving you, do they have any control over that? A Not at all. Q Let me ask this: Why not? Why don't you or the board of directors have any say in that, considering you guys are in charge of the nonprofit? A We are in charge of the -- our job again -- I'm just going to repeat this again. Q Fair enough. A It's to act as a storage facility on behalf of the State, so all our job basically is to store whatever spots the State is sending over to us. Our job is to store those and to keep them safe, obviously, too, but that's what we do, so the board doesn't have any decision in terms of, you know, what blood spots come, what blood spots get moved or pulled. They don't act in that capacity and, furthermore, the board is not responsible for the -- you know, the day-to-day operations are handled by me and my team of people, so they don't get involved at that level. Q All right. Let me ask this: The blood samples when they're stored at the Biobank, who owns them, if you know? A I'm assuming that the State of Michigan owns them. Q Okay. Now when you say -- and, again to be fair, I try to be the fair attorney with these depositions. A Yeah; yeah. Q Do you know the State owns them or are you just simply guessing? A I'm guessing. I don't know. I should have answered that I don't know the information to that question. Q And that's fair. I only what you to answer what you can tell me here today, okay? A I don't know the answer to that question. Q Would you have any opinion, as the director of the Biobank, as to whether I own my son's blood spots that are in your bio? A My personal opinion or --Q Well, I mean, I'm asking -- I guess what I'm trying to understand is that there's blood, the blood spots come from the bodies -- I mean, live bodies, obviously, not dead bodies, but live bodies of children that ultimately make its way following the newborn screening to your facility at the Biobank. I guess I'm trying to understand do you, as the director of the Biobank, have a position as to who owns those blood spots? A Yeah. I believe that --MR. KENNEDY: I'm going to object just to the extent that it calls for my client to reach a legal conclusion, but other than that, Doctor, you can answer. A Okay. So this is just -- this would just be my opinion based on just my experience as a professor and knowing a lot about records and things of that sort. So the actual record -- the information, the content, belongs to the -- to the individual, and I would say that the physical, the tangible piece, probably would be owned by, in this case the State or healthcare provider if we're talking about medical records. So I think the content, you know, belongs to the patient or in this case to the child or the parents, and then the physical components, the actual cards and things like that belongs to the actual facility, i.e. the State Lab or the State. That's my opinion of how it should work. Q Okay. I'm going to --A And I say that because of the simple fact that I do know that if someone wants to have their card removed and just based on the requests that I get from the State of Michigan, that a card can be removed at any time. All the parent would have to do is request that it be removed and it's my understanding, and I just know this from my operations, that the State will then tell me to send the card back to them, and I'm assuming that card is destroyed at that time, and that's --Q Okay. Let me ask this, though, and I guess we can finish that thought here. I was trying to establish -- and forgive me. There's some questions I know the answer to these. A Yeah. Q It's just this is my opportunity to ask you to get them on the record. A Right. Q So bear with me. A Yeah. Q I was asking a little bit earlier about the concept of me coming to you to remove those cards, and you said you couldn't do that? A That's correct. Q All right. And you said -- I believe you answered, and if not, please correct me and tell me the answer, that the board of directors can't direct that a blood sample of my son can be pulled and given back to me or destroyed, correct? A That's correct. Q Okay. Who would? A The State. Q All right. Who at the State has that authority? Who do you take that direction from? A So we have a state coordinator that we deal with where most of our communications come from. Her name is Shelby, I believe, and I kind of went blank on her last name. But we have -- Atkinson, A-t-k-I-n-s-o-n. She's the liaison for the State of Michigan and that's pretty much who we have all of our interaction with. Q Let me show you -- I'm going to pull up right here an email, a set of emails. A Okay. Q Let me see if I can make this work. Yep, here we go. Okay. I just want to use this as kind of a reference point, okay? A. Okay. Q. I know I made a big deal in the court case about the TransHit Bio aspect thing and I know that never went to fruition, and I get all of that. But I want to show these emails here as a concept. A. Okay. Q. My understanding -- and I'm just -- to shortcut this, my understanding is that Trans-Hit Bio is a -- I call them a blood broker, but they're a sample broker that reached out to the Biobank to potentially make contact to buy or have access to blood spots. A. Okay. Q. Fair enough? A. I don't know really who Trans-Hit Bio -- I don't recall who this person is, but if you say --Q. Okay. Let's scroll down here because I think they emailed you originally. A. Okay. And they may have, yeah. Okay. Q. You're like me, you get 4,000 mails a day? A. Probably 10,000. Q. So here's an email, November 2nd, 2017, a woman named Sophie Dahan. A. Yeah, I remember this. Q. Okay. All right. As I understand it -- I don't want to get into the finer points of this, but I understand they reached out to you to see if they could potentially buy samples from the Biobank? A. That's correct. Q All right. So as I understand it, is that you forwarded that discussion to Dr. Shah and Dr. Lyon-Callo, and I'm going to show you up here -- oh, I'm sorry. I'm mistaken; let me correct that. You sent it to Carrie Langbo. A. Yeah. Q. Who is that? A. So Carrie Langbo is no longer with the State, from my understanding. The new person is the Shelby Atkinson person. Q. Shelby. That was going to be my question. Carrie -- Shelby is the new Carrie, correct? A. That's correct, yes. Q. All right. So you forward that email on to them, it looks like a couple of days later, about reviewing it and there's some emails back and forth to this aspect, but what I want to show here, there's an email back to Carrie where -- I'm just going to again shortcut this. Dr. Lyon-Callo and Dr. Shah discussed this with Legal. They went back and forth with this and they ultimately decided that they did not want Trans-Hit Bio to be able to buy samples from the Biobank. A. Okay. Q. All right. Do you recall -- and then it looks like that they ultimately said, "Please thank Dr. Yancey for reaching out about this potential." A. Okay. Q. To me it appears that they're calling the shots about the use or access to those bio samples, those blood samples themselves. Is that fair? A. I think so, yes. Q. Okay. What role does Dr. Shah and Dr. Lyon-Callo play in regards to the Biobank? A. So Sarah I believe is the --Q. Let me be clear. So Sarah is Dr. Sarah Lyon-Callo, correct? A. That's correct. Q. Okay. A So Carrie at that time reported to Sarah. So I guess I'm so, yeah. We interact with them throughout the day, but they make the calls in terms of -- I don't -- my team, we don't get involved. When things come directly to us like requests for blood spots or, you know, what is the approval process, we send everything over back to the DHHS and they're the individuals that make the decision in terms of who gets approved and who can basically use the blood spots for whatever research purposes. So I'm not involved in that piece, so to answer your question it is DHHS who is making those types of decisions or --Q Would Dr. -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. I didn't mean to interrupt you; go ahead. A -- or making the decisions in terms of who are and can use blood spots for whatever research purposes. So, again, going back, my job is strictly to act as a depository for the blood spots, so I'm not involved in these types of decisions at all, I'm not, and so in our guidance from these individuals, Sarah. Now, you know, again, Sarah is not here -- Carrie is not here. Shelby is our primary contact for the State of Michigan, so in terms of the approval processes and all those kinds of things, it's handled at the State level and not by the Biobank. Q Okay. Let me ask this: Is Dr. Lyon-Callo one of the decision-makers on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services with the Biobank? A I'm not really -- I don't interact with her, so I don't know the answer to that, to be honest with you. Q Okay. And what about --A My (indiscernible) is copied on the email sometimes, but I don't even know if this person is still there because I haven't seen her name in -- they have a lot of turnover, so there has been -- you know, there are a lot of people that I worked with when I first started in '17 that are not here anymore. It's constant, you know, turnover. They move on to different areas, so I haven't talked to Sarah in years, I don't think. Q Okay. Well, let me finish out, and as to Dr. Shah, is he one of the decision makers? A Yes, he is. Q So let me ask this question: If you got an email from Dr. Shah that said you're authorized -- the Biobank is authorized to disperse ten punches to a particular researcher, would that be in your mind authorization from the State? A. Yes and no. I've never got a request from him because he's not involved in the operations, but I know that Dr. Shah is in charge of the State Lab, so I would assume that it would be okay if I got a request from him, but that would be very unusual because he's not involved at that level. Q. Okay. What about if Dr. Lyon-Callo had sent you a similar directive by email that this particular researcher can have access to, say just as an example, ten samples? A. Yeah, because I believe at that time this was the director, and so, you know, if they send me a request to pull it, I would pull it. Q Okay. All right. Fair enough. Let's make a note here. A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q So I guess during all of this -- I guess to bottom line all of this, when you get a directive from the State to do something about the Biobank, you're acting in concert with whatever it is that they're telling you to do, fair? A That would be correct. Q Okay. Let's change gears a little bit. Okay. What role -9 so let's talk about the Biobank just generally at a high level, okay? A Okay. Q As I understand, I think you confirmed earlier, it's a nonprofit corporation, correct? A Correct. Q All right. And we talked about your board of directors. What role does Wayne, MSU, You of M and VanAndel apply as to the operation of the Biobank? A So as I mentioned, for the most part it may have been a different arrangement prior to when I got there. It's supposed to be a partnership between all of the universities. I think Wayne, and that's probably because, you know, I guess Wayne is the person that's actually appointing the director of the operations. I think that Wayne State, by me being an employee of Wayne State and all of my predecessor, that we're probably more involved in the overall operations than our other partners. It's each person sits on the board. You know, there is a university affiliation for each member on the board, and so again I think from a collaborative perspective you can get input from that way, but just in terms of operations I would say that Wayne State, primarily me at this particular given time, will be more involved. We -- I think when it first started it was more of a real partnership where they handled -- they donated the software to use for the scanning of the blood spots, and then the You of M would contribute some things financially, but that has changed, at least since I've been here. We're pretty much the primary coordinators in terms of the operations of the storage facility. Q Okay. Let me ask this: I'm just kind of covering different areas on this. We were talking about as I understand, each of those four entities appoints someone to serve as their representative on the board of directors, true? A That's true. Q Is any one of those particular individuals the current chairman or chairperson of the board? A Yes. That would be Ed. Q I'm sorry? A Ed. Q Oh, Ed? A Yes. He's the -- he acts as the president of the board. Q Do you know if that was done pursuant to any sort of vote or any sort of particular process? A I don't know that information. Q In the last year when -- I mean, let me ask it this way: Does the board meet on a regular basis? A We do. We meet twice a year. Q Okay. In the time that you've been on the board has there ever been a vote to nominate and accept Ed as the chairman or is it just gone without saying? A Gone without saying. Q All right. As part of -- let me see if I have that here. As part of -- as part of the discovery in this process, I have asked for a number of documents from the State Defendants that have been happily provided. I'm sharing with you what's been marked as Exhibit Number A for purposes of this deposition, and this is a document that was provided to me in response to that discovery. Take a moment and take a look at this. (Deposition Exhibit A marked) Q. Just let me know when you're ready. A. Okay. Q Okay. Taking a look at this, I've been asking you some oral questions about the nature of the relationship between the Biobank and the board of directors and the Department of Health and Human Services. Does this picture or graphic accurately depict the relative relationships between those three entities that we've been discussing? A. Yes. Well, I can only speak for the Biobank. I can't speak on the other side because I'm not really sure about some of the -- I don't get involved with the advisory boards really. I do attend some of their meetings, but I don't understand all of the logistics regarding it. I can only tell you on the right side in terms of my reporting structure, how that works, but I do know that they do have a scientific advisory board. I just kind of know that information just from, you know, interacting with them and just in terms of when they tell me that someone has to get approval, so I know that there is a SAB board, but in terms of the community advisory or advisory board, I do know that they -- because I've participated in some of the advisory boards. I think they have a meeting once a year and I've been invited to attend that, but I can't go on record by saying that this is completely how their structure is because I don't get involved on their side. Q. Let me clarify my question. Let's take out -- looking at this graphic, if we take out the community advisory -- or community values advisory board and the scientific advisory board boxes, and we have the three that's left, and that was the three I was referencing, does the text and information as this is structured a proper diagram of how these three entities, being DHHS, Biobank, and the board of directors fit with each other? A. Yes, those are correct. Q. And as they describe their services -- as they describe the bullet points in each box as to what each of them does, is that an accurate description of what each of them does? A. I can speak for some of the things in this black box for what they do. There's some I can't. I have no idea what they mean whey they say "honest broker." I mean, "public education." I'm not involved in that piece, so I can't --Q. Okay. Let me ask this question: In just the Biobank box are those statements correct? A Okay. Yes, it is. I'm not really sure about the -- they have MDHHS non-voting representative. I'm not sure what that means. Q. I'm sorry. I just want you to focus on just the Biobank box, not the --A. Okay. Q. Are those bullets there correct on what you guys do at the Biobank? A. Yes, that's correct. Let me clarify something, though. So it says assigned study specific ID codes to remain confidentiality, so I just need to clarify that because that's very important. Q. Okay. Please do. A. So what happens is that anytime that a study is approved by the State, that ascension -- the ascension number that we talked about, that eight-digit number, what happens is that when it says here, we also assign our own number too that's attached to that ascension number. So it's identifiable, and then we go through another process of doing another identifiable number by adding another two-digit or three8 digit number on top of that number that comes in, so if a researcher ever needed to know, you know, what number was pulled for what, we're able to kind of tell them that. So if the number 12345678 comes from the State, we'll add a 01, 02, 03. It depends on how many spots they're given. Q Okay. So from that information, you could look at that number in your database and you could tell what spots have been pulled --A For that reason. Q -- according to what study then, correct? A Correct. Q Okay. If a researcher wanted to have access to the Biobank spots, say they needed a thousand of them just as a hypothetical. A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q Could they make that request directly to you and have that request fulfilled? A No. Q All right. What process would have to be -- as you understand it has to be fulfilled for having access to blood spots for research purposes? A We refer them back to DHHS for approval. Q What process, if you know, do they undertake? I don't need the scientific part of it. I'm talking -- I want to take this to kind of a 35,000 foot level. What process do they undertake to let you know -- well, strike that. Let me start that question over. See, I start with a great idea up here and it just doesn't come out through the mouth the right way. I guess what I want to know is what process do you understand occurs when someone wants to have access to blood spots and you send them over to DHHS? What happens before the point that it comes back to you and the State says, "Give them the 1,000 spots"? A So it's my understanding that it goes -- I mean, the researcher would have to elaborate on the reason, I guess, for the research, why they need the spots to study. It's my understanding that they go through a variety of different communities including the scientific advisory board, you know, if -- of course, if the research is even approved. And then it has to go through a variety of IRB committees for approval, so that's my understanding, but I don't know how the initial decision is made in terms of who they allow and for what purpose, and those kinds of things, so I'm not involved and I don't understand that piece. Q Okay. But you would agree that you act in joint concert with the State, though. When the State says, "Give them these samples," you guys do it over at the Biobank? A Repeat that question. Q Fair enough. So what I'm wanting to understand is the State -- somebody at the State, be it Shelby or Carrie, says, "The State has approved this research study," you guys in agreement with them whether you -- you know, you basically hand over that material and agree to do so at their direction? A That's correct. So once a person is approved, we receive an email telling us that a researcher has been approved and eventually we will get a request to pull the blood spots, so they basically make the decision in terms of what blood spots are pulled from the depository. Q At that point right there, say you get a -- you get an email from -- like the email you were just describing that says, "Pull these 1,000 spots for," you know, to sell a punch, right, or provide a punch to a researcher. Do you take any steps to contact whose blood spots they are or their parents to get consent to give those samples out? A No. Q Okay. Why not? A Because we're not involved in that process. We're just a storage facility. Q. All right. Do you know as part of -- at the time that a research project is proposed and being reviewed by the State and ultimately for approval, does the State attempt to contact the person whose blood spot that belongs to or their parents to get their consent as part of -- before giving out that particular spot? A. I don't know that information. Q. Have you ever heard of it happening? A. (Indiscernible) --Q. You cut out there for a second. MR. KENNEDY: I'd just object to the extent it calls for hearsay. Q Okay. Go ahead, Dr. Yancey. I should have explained when we do objections, unless he directs you not to answer, we fight it out with the judge later whether my question is any good or not. So you answer the question nonetheless, okay? A Okay. Q My question to you was have you ever heard of the State providing MR. ELLISON: Jeremy, I acknowledge your objection for restating the question. Q. Have you ever heard of the State actually contacting the person whose blood spot it belongs to or their parents when approving a study? A. No. Q You as the director of the Biobank, do you require that consent be obtained from the person whose blood spot it belongs to or their parent prior to giving out what blood sample? A No. Q. Does the board of directors at Biobank require that? A. No. Q Has there ever been a discussion or decision about whether consent needed to be obtained before giving out samples? And again, this is in the context of when a study has been approved. A No. Q Do you believe as the director -- and again, I'm asking you as director, in your role of director of the Biobank -- that such consent is required? A Do I believe? Q Yeah, do you believe it's required? A It's my understanding that all of that is done way before it gets over to us at the Biobank, all the consent forms, just knowing a little bit about the process. You know, it's my understanding that the consent forms are all done, you know, way before it gets over to us in terms of the storage facility. So I've always assumed that there's been a consent filed -- a consent form on file. Q I'm going to ask you -- acknowledging this is a hypothetically question, I'm asking you this in your capacity as director of the Biobank. Let's assume for the sake of argument that that consent was not obtained from somebody's sample who is in the Biobank. Do you think you have an obligation to obtain consent before giving a blood spot for an approved study out to a researcher when that blood spot belongs to a person or their parent? A I think a consent form should always be, you know, the primary decision before any blood spot is given to anyone. But, again, I don't get involved in that process. Q Fair enough. I understand that. Let me ask this question: Do you as the director or anybody under you who is under your purview at the Biobank, do you guys check each blood spot to make sure of the -- let me try that again. That came out bad. I guess what I'm trying to -- what I'm trying to understand is do you guys -- when you get a statement or a directive from the State that says, "Give out these 1,000 blood spots to the researcher," do you guys go back and check to make sure that consent was obtained before giving out any of those samples? A No. Q Any reason why not? A For one, when we get the information, remember we're not getting any names. We're just getting a number, and so we would have no idea who the blood spot belonged to to be able to get a consent form, and then if we were to get a consent form, then we would be exposed to someone's personal information and that's not how the Biobank is set up. Q Okay. Does the Biobank -- and, again. Forgive me. There's questions I know the answers to, but I've got to ask you as part of this. A Yes. Q Does the Biobank in any way ask or otherwise obtain its own consent form from each donor of the blood spot before putting it into the Biobank? A No. Q Same question except as to removing a blood spot and giving it to a researcher. Is any sort of consent obtained by the Biobank itself? A No. Q Does the Biobank store any of the consent forms -- let me back up. Let me preface this the right way. You just testified earlier that consent forms were obtained as part of the earlier part of the process. A I'm assuming that it was. I can't go on official record. I'm just giving you just, you know, general experience, just, you know, in seeing different emails and things of that sort and kind of understanding a little bit about when I first got in the role, I went on the internet and did research about how this while piece worked and I've got a little bit of information. So I can't -- do you know what I mean? I just want to be clear that I don't -- I'm just telling you from I guess a private or personal, not in my -5 not in my capacity as a director because I'm not involved in many of these components that you're asking about. Q Well, let me ask it this way. Let me ask you this way. Does the Biobank have access to or otherwise store any consent forms of any type related to the blood samples that are stored at the facility? A No. Q Do you know where -- if there are consent forms, where those consent forms would be stored at? A No, I don't know where they would be stored at. Q Let me ask kind of a weird question. Let's just assume for the sake of argument that the judge in this case finds that consent was not properly obtained, and these samples are being held contrary to consent. Do you have the -- if the judge was to order you to return these samples back to their owners, would you have the authority to direct your employees to fulfill that task? A No. Q Who would? A The State. Q And when you say the State --A The reason why, we wouldn't know -- if the judge -- if there was an order that came through, I wouldn't be able to return them because I wouldn't even know who they belonged to because we're not able to identify the individual. Because we operate as a 501(c) company, I'm assuming that if there's a court order and they said, "You've got to give these blood spots up," I would refer them back to the State. Q Let me ask you this: If the judge -- again, I'm acknowledging this as a hypothetical, okay? If the judge says, "These samples have to be destroyed." Would you have the ability to destroy those samples as the director of the Biobank? A No. Q Who would be the person that would have to make the decision to destroy those -- or would have to be the one to give the command to destroy those samples? A I'm not sure who that person would be, particularly at the state level, but I would assume that it would have to be someone at the State level because that's who we interact with. Q Okay. As I understand, there is a postextraction request system that's been put into place that allows parents to ask for samples to be destroyed after they've gotten into the Biobank, true? A I don't know about that system. Q Okay. Have you ever been, as the director, know about or seen or otherwise been directed by anybody at the State to destroy samples at the request of a parent? A We do not destroy any samples. We've received requests to pull samples. Q Okay. So let me just give you a -- well, I'll give you a straight-up one. I made such a request when I found out my son's blood samples were in your Biobank, okay? A Okay. Q I filled out the form. I sent it in. A few weeks -- a few months later after I sued them -- that's another issue; don't worry about that -- I get a letter back that says, "Your son's samples have been destroyed." A Okay. Q To your knowledge, how would those samples have gotten out of the Biobank and been destroyed, if you know? A So what happens is when those -- I do kind of recall that form now. So any time that form is completed, what happens is we get an email -- I get an email basically from the State and the State basically tells me to pull ascension number blah, blah, blah, and then I go into the storage area and we pull that blood spot. We're getting daily blood spots every single day from the State of Michigan, you know, all of the current ones that are being done and there are still older ones that we're still trying to get stored, so there's a bag that we get every day with the current blood spots, and what we do is we put that particular blood spot, based on the number that they emailed us about, and we put it in a storage bag and, you know, there is a piece of paper we complete that basically -- it's like a little carbon receipt just to let them know that -- we keep a copy on file so that we know for a fact that they requested that and we put that in the catalog spot, and we send it on its way to the State. Q Okay. So this kind of brings me back to where we started on this discussion of the idea if I wanted my son's blood sample destroyed, I can't come to you. I can't come to your board of directors. I've got to go through the State officials at DHHS? A That's correct. Q All right. Okay. Let's switch -- I'm going to take this off for a second, and I'm going to open up another one. Oh, here it is right here. (Deposition Exhibit K marked) Q. All right. I'm giving you what I've marked as Exhibit K for purpose of this deposition. Again, I'll represent to you this is a document that the State Defendants provided me as part of the discovery process. A. Okay. Q. As I understand looking at this form -- I'll give you a chance to look at it -- this is the price list for getting access to samples and/or portions of samples, which I've come to learn is called punches or a portion of that blood sample. A. Correct. Q. Take a look at that and see if you can confirm that this is the case. A. So, yeah. What you're showing me is a listing of what we charge for the processing of blood spots. Not the processing, but the administrative costs that are involved with processing. Q. Okay. So if, for example, I was a Michigan academic, meaning I'm taking that to mean a Michigan university researcher, and I wanted a whole random sample punch, a whole spot, for example --A. Okay. Let me back up a little bit. I'm taking a look at this, so this particular -- this is not -- this is something -- so there are costs that the State has, and then there are charges that we have on our end. This is not one of our documents that we have for the Biobank, so this doesn't look like -- yeah, this is not -- I don't know what this is. Q. Okay. Let me ask this question --A. Yeah, I do have -- we do charge. I do have a -- we do have our own price list, but these are not our rates at all. This is something that the State does. They charge, and then we charge also. Q. All right. That's something new. I haven't -- you've just educated me on something I did not put together before, and so I want to explore that a little bit, so my questions may be a little weird in that respect. Looking at this spreadsheet right here, are these the prices the Biobank charges researchers? A. These are -- this list is not a current list. I don't know how old this is, but this is not -- it's very similar to this amount, but these amounts don't look familiar. We have like a three-layer tier system for our blood spots. Q. If you have a request to get access to punches or whole spots for distribution to a researcher or to a -- in my mind I want to use the word "customer," but someone who's trying to get access to the spots themselves for whatever purpose, do you guys have a price list that I could get access to? A. Yes. It's on our -- if you go to our -- it's on -- I believe it's on our website, but we have our own price structure that we can get you a copy of. Q. Okay. What I'm going to ask you to do is would you get a copy of that to your attorney? A. Okay. Q. So I'm going to make a request for that because this is something I've never -- I've always -- well, I guess maybe I've wrongly assumed that this was the price for the whole package on the thing. A. No, and you know what? I don't know if this is an older -3 it doesn't have like the Biobank on here. I don't -- this 4 - this just doesn't look familiar to me. I'm just going to be honest with you. I don't know. I do know that the State also does charging on their end and we charge on our end, but this doesn't look like -- I know for a fact this is not my current pricing system. It could be an older document that you have and they've changed the way -- the Biobank had changed the way in terms of the payment structure. It looks familiar just in terms of the prices are a little bit close and some areas are not. We only have a three-tier system, so this has -- one, two, three, four, five; out of state academic, out of state government. I've never seen this, so I don't know what it is. Q Okay. All right. So just, if you could, get that over to Mr. Kennedy, and I'll make that request, you know, in due course. A Okay. Q Let me ask this question, and I'm kind of just flying by the seat of my pants right now. If you guys -- the State charges whatever it charges. Biobank charges whatever it charges. Do you guys send your bill to the State so they added onto this, do you know? Or do you bill directly to the researcher? A No, we bill directly to the researchers. Q All right. And what happens to that money that you guys collect? A It comes back into the Biobank. Q Okay. So it just gets put into the general fund of the Biobank? A Yes. Q Do you guys know if you get any of this money -- again, let me just -- we'll just assume for the sake of argument right now that what you're looking at right now as Exhibit K is the price list that the DHHS charges the researchers. A. Okay. Q. Do you know if you get any of that money or a percentage of that money at all? A. We do not. Q. That's going to transition me to my next bar here. How does the Biobank operate in terms of funding? A. Okay. Q. How does -- what kind of -- I mean, looking at this, looking at the number, I'm going to represent to you from the data the State sent me, 63,009 samples have been provided so far, at least as to what's been disclosed to me. That works out to about -- assuming -- even assuming it's $9 a piece, I mean we're talking a half a million dollars. Maybe it's a little bit more. How does the Biobank operate in terms of funding? A. So we operate a variety of ways. We have a variety of funding that comes through to pay for the operational expenses with the Biobank. One is that we get a grant from the State of Michigan every year and that grant is approximately 140,000, I believe, per year. It's actually 7 - it's actually -- I believe it's 154. 14,000 of that money goes back to the University in what we call indirect costs, and that's just the money, the F&A that comes back to the University, so our actual physical amount is $140,000 from that grant. We use that, and then we also use the money that we collect for the spots, for the processing, the administrative costs that are associated with the processing of these blood spots for the researchers. Our average charge is currently -- I believe it's $10 per punch now, and so the money we collect from that goes into the operational cost. And then also there are some other funding sources, for example, we have students that are employed by Wayne State University that is paid by Wayne State University, but they actually help process the blood spots for us, so that's not --Q Is that like work-study kids? A Correct. Work-study, and then we also have what's called temporary technicians, so these are people that are basically -- they don't meet the eligibly of a full-time student or part-time student, and we can hire them as a temporary worker, and then we just pay them a salary. Q Okay. All right. A And they get paid by -- everybody gets paid by Wayne State University, and then we also have an operational manager full-time that works for the Biobank and he's also paid. Then we have a variety of other different operational costs like rents. We have to pay for the freezer bank itself. We have a big high payment that we pay, so basically all of that money goes to the operational expenses. The grant doesn't cover nowhere near -- probably the grant covers approximately I would say 40 to 50 percent of our overall operational expenses. Q Okay. Do you get any money from any private sources? A No. Q Do you get any money from -- setting aside, obviously, the work study, the salary part of this with the kids and the temporaries, does Wayne State, U of M, MSU, and VanAndel, do they supply any money? A No, not currently. We would like for them to, but --Q. Yeah, right. A. -- they don't. I believe at one point prior to me it used to be more and I was explaining that earlier. It was more of they give financial contributions, but I think over the years that's changed and Wayne State would be the primary person that would basically donate on behalf of the --Q Okay. The pricing that you guys charge that we're talking about that goes back to your general fund as part of your funding, prices you charge for the punches, is that something that's established by the State or your board of directors? A It's established by the board of directors. Q Does that have to be approved by the State at all? Do you know? A No, it does not. Q Understanding you're not an attorney and have probably a better life, do you happen to know if there's any legal authority that authorizes the Biobank to charge fees for providing those samples? A I have no information of that, no. Q And once you guys determine whatever the fee is, you just I mean, is it like an invoice you send to the researcher? A Yes, we send them an invoice. We have a billing system. Q Let me do this: I'm going to see if we can just -- just as an example for this -- yeah, right here. I'm going to present to you what is -- your lawyer -- your lawyer provided me a whole bunch of documents. A. Okay. (Deposition Exhibit F marked) Q. This is Exhibit F for purposes of this deposition. Here it is. Okay. This would be -- I'm presenting Exhibit F. This would be an example of an invoice you would send in this, "Future Diagnostic Solutions"? A. Correct, yep. Q. All right. A. Can you go down a little bit? I want to see the title of the --Q. This? A. Yeah, yep. Okay. Thank you. I wanted to make sure it's our invoice. That's a copy of our invoice. Q. Okay. All right. And the second page of this is -- with counsel's okay I will produce these. I'd like to be able to redact the account number. A. Yeah, I was going to say we really need to redact that. MR. ELLISON: Jeremy and Aaron, would you have any objection to me redacting that when I submit those to the court reporter? MR. KENNEDY: No. MR. LEVIN: No. MR. ELLISON: Okay. All right. I think the same thing here. They've got an account number here on these checks as well. Q This, for example -- I mean, this would be a check I've seen made out to the Biobank which matches the number right here? A Yep. Q And so you guys would get a payment? A That is correct. Q Okay. But just -- I mean, I guess to kind of finish this thought out, though, you would not have sent them these samples unless the State had approved for you guys to send the sample? A That would be correct. Q Okay. We're almost done. A couple of details I just want to get ahold of. As I understand from the various pieces of literature I've seen, there are samples that are currently within the Biobank that go back to -- I've seen a 1984 and 1987. Do you know one way or the other how far back the samples go that are being stored? A. Okay. So this is always a hard question for me and I started to write it down for you. So we have '96 and current -- '96 to current. When I say current, give and take that it takes --Q. Well, you're getting samples every day, you said, so --A. Well, yeah, but then they're doing the testing. It's at the lab, and so it takes about -- it's a two-week lag time, I guess is what I'm trying to tell you, but we should have everything from '96 to current. Q. Okay. Is there -- so on the -- on some of the literature it says -- even some of your own literature is saying that it goes back to like the -- I've seen one that says July of 1984, another one that says 1987. A. Yeah. Q. Do you have any information about if that's true, how far that goes back? A. I don't know how far they go back, but I do know that -- and I should tell you this, that every day we get current blood spots and then sometimes -- the plan is to eventually have us to store all of the blood spots from when the program first started, and I believe it was '84, maybe '85, I thought. I don't know. But in any case, there's a backlog to get those spots over to us, so sometimes we get current and we may get something, you know, from -- since we're in 2009, they would go to 2008. So we would get some -- you know, some of the older spots for us to store for 2008. The plan is to eventually have them all housed and stored with us, but the State hasn't been able to get those older spots to us because there is things they have to do on their end. So eventually, the plan is for us to have all of the spots from when the program first started when the State started testing. I don't know how feasible that would be, as the director of the Biobank, because we wouldn't have -- I mean, I mentioned earlier there will be room capacity issues and we're going to run into that problem in a couple years, and so that will need to be a conversation that we have with the board. But we do get -- we're current getting older stuff and we get current stuff at the same time. Q Let me ask you this: Say I wanted -- I'm a researcher and I want samples from 1988, for example. Where would those be stored? Where would I get those? A You would get them from the State. Q. Do you know where the actual physical samples from 1988 are stored? A. I think it's in your own State Lab. Somewhere in the State Lab is what I understand. Q. I mean, you don't know for sure one way or the other? A. No, I don't. Q. Okay. A. I just know that it's at the State. Q. Let me ask this question: I've learned that there's a storage facility that the State has that's storing samples in Lansing off the -- not at the lab site, but at an offsite storage facility. Does that help at all in refreshing your recollection at all? A. No, it doesn't. I don't get --Q Fair enough. At your -- for the samples that you do have, who has actual physical access to those samples? A Just me and the operations manager that I have there. Q. So that was Chris? A. That's Christopher Kraus. Q. Is he still there? A. Yes, he is. Q. Okay. Another question that I'm hoping you can answer is how many samples do you think you have at the Biobank? A. I could not tell you that. Q. I mean, are we talking hundreds? Are we talking --A. I could probably tell you that, but it would take me some time to tell you that. Let me clarify that. We have thousands and thousands. I mean, the room is -- we've got - I mean, we have hundreds of thousands of them. I could tell you that; it would just take me a little while. Q. I've heard -- I've heard that the State's got 4 million and I've heard they've got 7 million. I've heard -- I mean, the numbers -- I was just curios if you knew offhand on that. A. No. Q. Okay. Are you familiar at all -- you somewhat hinted at it earlier, but are you familiar at all when the State has made the assertion that they act as the honest broker? A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q Do you understand what that concept means at all? A No, I mentioned that earlier. That's the first time I've ever seen that. Q Do you have the ability, if I was to come down there and say, you know, "Dr. Yancey, I'd like you to" -- "I got approval from the State because I'm here on behalf of the Court. I'd like you to pull a sample of my sister's child," for example, and I know you somewhat answered but I want to make sure I've got it clear for the record. I come down there. You haven't talked to the State. I haven't talked to the State. I just have an approval from the judge to say, "Go get Phil's sister's son's sample," right? A. Uh-huh (affirmative). Q. Do you have the capability to be able to locate that sample if I was to do that say tomorrow? A. With a name? Q. With just a name, yes. A. No, no. There are no names at all on anything, any blood spot out of all of the hundreds of thousands that we have. No name. Q Okay. But to be clear, you couldn't go to a computer also and say -- type in this guy's name or the kid's name or birth date or some other thing and look up and say -- unless you actually have that number from the State to correlate it; fair enough? A That is fair. Q Okay. So sorry because I actually split my question there. Let me make sure I get it clear the right way. A Okay. Q So you would not have the ability, for example, to type in a child's name, social security number, date of birth and be able to find that sample from your computer or any sort of index onsite at the Biobank? A That is correct. Q Okay. So by extension, my next question, which I kind of veered into was that the only way you could pull a particular person's sample would be if the State provided you with the ascension number that is associated with that particular sample? A That is correct. Q At the facility do you maintain any other data -- well, let me ask it this way: Any other data that you maintain relative to the samples? And let me give you some examples of what I mean. Child's name, blood type, date of birth, their weight when they were born, the time that they were born, any physical or physiological data that would allow you to associate with a particular sample? A No. Q Let's pretend -- I'm just going to -- let's do a pretend here. This is a hypothetically. I want to pull -- I'm a researcher. I want to pull 100 samples of blood samples from children born after the Flint water crisis, and I want to be able to see what -- I'm researching something with blood, right? Do you have any capability to be able to say, "I can pull these samples based on the zip code," for example? A No. Q All right. Could I do that with information -- could I -2 well, let me ask you this: If I wanted those samples, is there some way that you know of that the State could provide me with a list of ascension numbers to be able to pull those samples? A Yeah, I'm certain that -- yeah; yes. Q Okay. So the State has the data, you have the blood? A That's correct. Q All right. Do you know what information is available from the State in terms of data associated with particular with individual blood spots? A No, I do not. Q Is there any sort of documentation that you guys -- you know, what if I was a researcher contacting you saying, you know, "Dr. Yancey, I'd like these" -- "I'd like the samples with these particular characteristics," how would I go about getting that? A. So they would be referred back to Shelby at the State of Michigan and I'm sure that they have a way that, you know, they can identify that information at the State level, but I don't have that information. Q Fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. Acknowledging our joke at the beginning about Band-Aids and Robitussin, humor me. A Right. Q Do you have any knowledge or expertise as to what sort of information can be extracted out of blood samples? A No. Q I have these -- my questions into blocks. You've answered a lot of them here. Forgive me if I asked you this: You said you're not dealing with any aspect of the consent process for the ongoing storage, use, or research uses for the blood samples, correct? A Correct. Q Let me -- I'm going to share a screen with you right here. A Okay. Q We're on the downward slope. It took a little longer than I thought, but we're almost done here. (Deposition Exhibit E marked) Q. I'm presenting you what's been marked by the deposition as Exhibit Number E. These have been provided by the State and I'm just going to scroll through them real quick, just kind of in a slow scroll, but if you want to look at anything in particular please let me know. These as I understand are various consent forms that the State claims provides consent. A. Okay. Q. It's my representation, not necessarily the State's representation. A. Gotcha. Q. Looking at these, have you ever seen these forms before? A. I've probably seen it once in our operations book, just a general form. You know, I think I've seen this when I first started, just a copy of the form, but I don't get any of these forms. Q. I'm going to again represent to you this is my representation, not necessarily the State's or anybody else's, but my representation is that if these are in fact the consent forms, there's no reference to the Biobank anywhere in these documents. My question -- I want to make sure. I want to be 100 percent clear. There are no other consent forms related to the Biobank that you're aware of, fair? A. So the Bio Trust is the Biobank. Q. Okay. You're jumping to my next section, believe it or not, but we can jump to that right now because I'm trying that's one of the questions I want to -- I haven't been able to get a clear understanding on, but bear with me for just one second here. Let's just separate out the Bio Trust for Health as something for a second, just set that aside. A. Okay. Q. Looking at these forms, these are not forms that you -- you or the Biobank have created, correct? A. Right. Q. All right. And again, recognizing whatever the Bio Trust is. We'll talk about that in a second. There's no other consent forms at all that you have on file, obtained, or executed or got in any way related to the blood samples, true? A. Correct. Q All right. Did you have anything -- and I say you meaning the Biobank, the Biobank have anything to do, to your knowledge, with the drafting of these consent forms? A Not during my time. Q Okay. Fair enough. And again, I appreciate it. Just what you know, okay? A Right. Q I'm going to make one more representation to you. For example, let's take a look at -- not the best copy in the world, but this is a copy -- this is, for example, Ms. LaPorte's son, and this one is -- this is -- just for reference, this is a consent form for the child we've identified. By federal law, we've got to identify them by initials for federal court purposes, but it's Child EMO. Looking right here, Ms. LaPorte indicated "No, my baby's blood spots may not be used for health research." But it goes on to say right below that the blood spots will be stored forever, but not used for research. Is that -- do you have any information or explanation as to why when someone does not want -- when a parent does not want their child's blood spot being used, that the blood spot will nevertheless be stored forever? A. No. Q Do you have any information as to whether or not a blood spot will or will not be included as part of the Biobank storage program if they click or select no, they don't want to be part of any health research? A No. Q Does the Biobank have any sort of process or procedure in place to identify -- that they know of to identify those samples that are in the Biobank but do not want to be part of the research or potential research projects? A No. Q Again, would you agree that that would be information that probably would have to be obtained from the State? A Correct. Q You answered that. Do you know of any details or standards by which parents are told about the Biobank program during the time that consent is being obtained? A No. Q Have you been asked or otherwise -- strike that. I take attorney/client privilege very carefully. Have you ever ascertained by your own actions or directed someone at your direction to determine whether or not the nine children who are part of this case, that their samples are within the Biobank facility? A Have I? Repeat that. I'm sorry. Q Fair enough. I just want to you know if you or Chris -because you had mentioned earlier that only you and Chris have access to the samples themselves, correct? A Right. Q Have you ever been asked or directed to go and check to see if these nine children's samples are in the warehouse, the coolers? A No; no. Q Do you know a Harry Hawkins over at DHHS? A No. Q Do you know -- I'm just -- Harry Hawkins passed away in the course of this case. He worked at DHHS. Do you happen to know what position he held or -- what I'm trying to find out, do you know who his replacement is? A. No, I do not. (Deposition Exhibit B marked) Q All right. The last -- I'm down to the last piece here. I'm going to show you -- let me go through the exhibits here. Can you see that -- without me redoing that, can you see the like bluish-purple graphic? A. Uh-huh (affirmative). Q. Okay. Good, so I don't have to redo that. All right. Taking a look at that, and we can zoom in if we need to a little bit, take a moment to take a look at that. A. Okay. Q. Okay. Does this accurately depict your understanding of what happens to leftover blood spots after the newborn screening process is complete? A. I can't really answer that. I mean, I can answer some parts of this document, but some I could not. Q. Okay. One of the things I -- again, this is my representation. A. Okay. Q. One of the things I've learned as part of this is that of the blood spots that are the leftovers, some of them are stored by the State and the balance of those are sent over to you at the Biobank. Do you know that to be true? A. Yes. I do know that they keep -- they do reserve some spots, and then they send the rest over to us for storage. I do know that piece. Q. Okay. So there's actually -- in addition to your storage facility, there is a second one with similar blood spots, some within the State DHHS system? A. I do understand that to be correct, yes. Q. Do you know why -- do you have any knowledge or understanding as to why the State has these two separate processes, meaning one being you with the Biobank and one being them with these other samples? A I don't know that answer, but I do know that sometimes they have to go back and retest things, I guess, and they want it to be readily available. I really don't know the answer. Q Do you happen too know where physically those other blood spots, those -- the ones the State retains but doesn't send to you, where they store those at? A. No, I do not. Q. You're not in charge or responsible for the storage of those in any way? A. No, I'm not. Q. Do you know what the State uses those other blood spots for? I mean, you mentioned -- you said you had suspected about other testing, but do you specifically know why they -- what they use those for? A. No. I've just heard that they use it for to retest at times, but I don't know the answer to that, I guess. Q Let's see here. So let me -- can you see my mouse? A Uh-huh (affirmative). Q All right. Good. Right here, this spot right here, this one blood spot is stored by the State Lab for only your personal use if needed. That's not the Biobank, correct? A That's correct. Q All right. Not to put words in your mouth, but I'm looking at here, your likely -- your option A and option B, correct? A. The blood spots go into a safe storage (indiscernible). Yeah, I'm A, and then the blood spots go into safe storage and will not be used for research to treat -- yep, and I could be B, but the State could possibly be B too. Q. Okay. All right. Can you explain your knowledge as to what is the Michigan Bio Trust for Health, as opposed to or different from or the same as the Michigan Neonatal Biobank? A. So I'm going to be real honest with you. I'm not that savvy in that area. Q. I'm glad you're honest. I appreciate that. A. This was before my time. I've tried to understand it and read on it a little bit. This is my understanding: So the Bio Trust was set up, I want to say -- I can't remember the year. It was set up as a program to manage the operations of the storage -- of the blood spot storage. Why it was set up that way, how they became a 501(c), blah, blah, I have no idea. I just -- I was just told, "This is your new area and you're going to be managing" under my other 50 million areas that I manage. But that's how I got involved in this. I didn't want it. It just came to me because the boss said, "You're going to have it," so I haven't had -- you know, I don't know the history, to be honest with you, you know, about the whole -- the Biobank and why they chose to set it up the way they did. I don't really have that information. I know that the Bio Trust, I can say this, that it's a variety of stakeholders, so you have the partners with Wayne State and You of M, VanAndel, et cetera, the State, you know, so there are a variety of stakeholders that are involved in, you know, the management of that, and that could have been the reason why it was set up as a trust, but I don't have that history. Q. Okay. Fair enough. Lastly -- or actually, I've got -- the last exhibit I want to show -- well, let me make sure. Let me look here. Just a couple of small follow-ups. Looking at --(Deposition Exhibit G marked) Q. I'm presenting you what's been marked as Exhibit Number G for purposes of the deposition. This has been provided by the State as the -- what I call the old brochure, and that's my name I give it, the one before the current one that's out called "After Newborn Screening." Do you have any -- did you have any involvement with the drafting of this document? A. No. Q. All right. Have you -- do you use this document or otherwise know of this document for purposes of the Biobank's operation? A. I don't -- this looks like -- I think I may have seen this at one point in the office. I'm not sure. It looks a little -- it doesn't look like a current one. I don't know how old this is, but I've seen -- I think I've seen this document before. Q. Okay. Does this --A. It looks familiar. Q. Okay. Let me ask this question: Does this document to your knowledge control or otherwise are a part of the way you operate your Biobank? A. I'm not understanding that question. Q. I guess let me say it this way: This is something the State created, it's not something the Biobank uses for its operation; would you agree with that? A. Correct. (Deposition Exhibit H marked) Q. I'm going to present to you now what's Exhibit H. A. Okay. Q. Again, this is what I call the new brochure. A. Okay. Q. There's two sides to it here. Did you have any involvement with the drafting and the putting together of this particular brochure? A. No, I do not. Q. Okay. Do you know if your predecessor did? A. I don't know that information. Q. And again, this is not something you guys created, used, or maintain as part of the Biobank operations, fair? A. Okay. So when you say use, I will have to tell you that I've seen some of these at the facility. Q. Okay. A. So sometimes what happens is that -- and I don't know if this is the right one, but we obviously do promote the Biobank at Wayne State University for our researchers, and so I've attended different -- any time that we hire faculty, part of my job is to promote the Biobank for research purposes to the researchers, so I've used some of the pamphlets that have already been created. I use those when we do what we call new faculty orientation, so I may share that information along with some other promotional type stuff. Q. Okay. A. So the Biobank is promoted for research purposes so that you know, so that new faculty know that we do have a way of -- you know, of using blood spots for research. Q. Okay. I want to get that zoomed in here. I want to draw your attention -- if you can, make sure you can see. On the bottom left-hand corner on your screen where I'm circling the Certificate of Confidentiality. A. Okay. Q. Do you see that there? A. Yep. Q. Okay. Does that -- does the Certificate of Confidentiality mean anything to you regarding the operation of the Biobank? A. No. Q. All right. That's not something that you know about that was either sought or petitioned for under your directorship? A. No. Q. All right. Okay. Two more here. I want to zoom out here. (Deposition Exhibit O marked) Q. This is a document that I will represent that used to be on your old website. I'm not sure if it made the transition in the time from the update. Do you recognize this? A. I do. Q. All right. Is this one of your brochures? A. It's one of my brochures, correct. Q. All right. Was this something you created or had created? A. I made modifications to it when I came onboard because some of the information may have changed. Q. Okay. Can you tell --A. My marketing department -- I have a marketing department that does all of our brochures and things. Q. Okay. Fair enough. And again, I don't know if I said it but this is Exhibit O for purposes of this deposition. Looking at -- if you can look toward the top right-hand side, I'm looking at those carts, that picture right there. A. Yep. Q. Is that the carts of how the blood samples are stored? A. That is correct. Q. And again, it's up to you if you want to take a chance to read this here, but based on that you acknowledged that this is a Biobank brochure, the information contained in it is accurate at least as of the time that they made the brochure; would you agree? A. That is correct. Q. All right. Fair enough. Lastly here, before I go to the Complaint, this one right here. (Deposition Exhibit L marked) Q. To your knowledge, these are -- I'm presenting to you what's been marked as Exhibit L. These are various documents I've got as part of another lawsuit I have going against the State, myself and my wife. A. You scared me there for a minute. I see this charge of open murder and I thought -- the first thing I thought, oh my God, did I -- have I been charged for something that I don't know about? My heart just literally dropped there. Q. Well, I can tell you I'm not charging you with nothing on that whatsoever, so anyway, these are documents that were in response to the other case in which I asked about whether law enforcement had access to the samples at the Biobank. A. Okay. Q. These are some of the documents -- and I'm representing to you that were provided in response to that discovery in the other case. A. Okay. Q. Do you recognize any of these documents as something that you had to deal with? A. Yeah. I remember either myself or my manager, I remember getting this or something like this when we first started. He may have gotten served with something. Q. Okay. A. I do remember this. It was probably at the beginning when I first started, because -- what's this, 2017? '18? Yeah. Q. They blocked the date. I don't know. That's --A. Yeah, I remember being served or he got served for this. Q. Okay. Do you recall whether or not the subpoena -- just whatever the document was, and I would represent it's a subpoena of some sort, that those -- that the samples were provided in response to those -- that legal demand? A. I wouldn't know that information because this particular this particular document was referred over to the State. Q. Okay. Do you remember at all whether the Biobank pulled any samples in response to a subpoena? A. I wouldn't be able to give you that information because I wouldn't even know who it was, so we get requests all the time from them to pull something, so I wouldn't be able to know if that number was associated with this person. Q. Okay. So I don't want to put words in your mouth, but just you would have got -- if there would have been a subpoena to the State, for example, like, for example, right here, the one I have in front of you on the screen. It's Exhibit L and someone is being charged with open murder and it was subpoena directed to the Department of Community Mental Health, State Public Health Lab Lansing, care of Harry Hawkins. If they had gotten that and they needed to provide that to the court, this would have just been a request to your office to pull like any other request would have been? A. Yes. Q All right. And you don't know any firsthand knowledge of actually receiving a subpoena yourself? A No. But we've -- like I said, I'm not sure. We've gotten 12 - I remember one subpoena since I've been there and again, I don't know if it was for this person, but I do remember being served. It may have been -- it may have been actually for this case, so I don't -- I don't know. Q. Okay. But you can't --A. In any case, if I had gotten a document like this, it would have immediately went to the State of Michigan. Q. Okay. Fair enough. And you don't know sitting here right now whether or not these subpoenas or legal demands were otherwise fulfilled, correct? A. No. Q. Okay. Let me just check. I've got one more -- I'm done with the exhibits. Let me just look right here. Forgive me. I may have asked this. I'm going through the Complaint. I just have a couple of notes on my Complaint that I filed on this. I just want to ask a couple questions on that and you may have answered it, so forgive me if I'm asking you again. If I -- no, strike that. You've answered -- no, you've answered that. I was just -- you've answered that, so. Does the Biobank have any policies about providing blood samples or blood spots to public or university researchers versus for-profit companies? A. No. Q. I've noticed -- and I don't have it on the screen right now, but the State provided me a list of research projects and for example, I see companies like Luminex, Genomics (ph) USA, Astoria Pacific, Advanced Liquid Logic, Asuragen -- A14 s-u-r-a-g-e-n, like for example, you guys provided 10,000 samples to them, for example. A. Uh-huh (affirmative). Q. These are all for-profit companies I've discovered on that. There's no -- to your knowledge, there's no prohibition or concern about providing samples to a for-profit company? A. I don't get involved in that information. Q. All right. Fair enough. All right. So this is going to sound silly. This is going to sound like a silly question. The blood samples are stored at a temperature and humidity controlled area within a facility near Wayne State University known as TechTown, correct? A. That's correct. Q. All right. A. TechTown is on Cass and Burroughs. Q. And you did -- as part of your responsibilities at the Biobank you've never obtained or otherwise sought a search warrant from a judge to be able to continue to store blood samples, true? A. True. Q. All right. MR. ELLISON: I think that's it, sir. I apologize. It took a little longer than I had thought, but I really sincerely appreciate it. I hope -- I hope this was not an unpleasant experience for you and I appreciate your time today. With that, I'm going to tender the witness to Mr. Kennedy and if he's got any questions, then Mr. Level might have some questions too for you, but otherwise, sir, I appreciate your time today. THE WITNESS: All right. Thank you, Mr. Ellison. MR. ELLISON: Thank you. MR. KENNEDY: Dr. Yancey, I just want to clear make a couple things clear for the record. EXAMINATION BY MR. KENNEDY: Q When you get a request from the State of Michigan to pull samples, blood spots, they give you specific numbers to pull, correct? A That's correct. Q They don't just ask to pull random numbers, correct? A Correct. Q So in one of the hypotheticals that Mr. Ellison asked with Dr. Shah saying pull ten samples, if you didn't get specific numbers for those samples to pull, you wouldn't pull anything, correct? A That's correct. Q All right. Okay. I just wanted to clear that up. MR. KENNEDY: I have nothing further, unless Mr. Levin does. MR. LEVIN: I do not. THE WITNESS: Who is Mr. Levin's representation? I missed that earlier and I want to ask that question before I leave. MR. KENNEDY: He's from the Attorney General's Office. THE WITNESS: Okay. MR. ELLISON: The joke would be, of course, there's no halo behind his head right now, right? So ha, ha, ha. Anyway, I have no further questions at this point right now either. Again, Dr. Yancey, I sincerely appreciate your time today and I appreciate your forthrightness. This concludes the deposition going forward.
