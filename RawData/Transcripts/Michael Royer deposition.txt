Q. Hi, Dr. Royer. My name is Adam Hanna. I'm theassistant U.S. attorney involved in this case defending the interest of the VA and the government. We've talked several times, but it's nice to see you by video. A. Good to see you. Q. Would you please tell the Court your full name? A. My name is Michael Charles Royer. Q. And Dr. Royer, where are you currently employed? A. At The Joint Pathology Center in Silver Spring, Maryland. Q. And what do you do there? A. I'm a dermatopathologist. Q. What is dermatopathology? A. Dermatopathology is a subspecialty both of dermatology and the pathology that specializes in the histologic evaluation of skin biopsies or excisions. Q. And how long have you held your position as a dermatopathologist there at The Joint Pathology Center? A. Since November 1st, 2017. Q. And were you a dermatopathologist elsewhere before that? A. I was. Q. Please tell us where. A. I was stationed both at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology right after my fellowship there in 2005 for one year. And then I was stationed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which subsequently turned into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, from 2006 until I retired from the Army in 2017.Q. So you were a commissioned officer in the military before joining the JPC? A. I was. Q. Okay. And what rank did you achieve before you retired? A. Colonel. Q. Interesting. I didn't realize that you were -didn't realize that you were a commissioned officer at one time. So altogether how many years experience do you have as a dermatopathologist?A. If you count my fellowship, it would be 18 years. Taking away the fellowship, it would be 17 years. Q. So starting with your undergraduate education, will you just kind of walk us quickly through your educational degrees and what year you received them, from where? A. I received a Bachelor of Science majoring in both biology and chemistry in 1991 from MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois. I went to the University of Wisconsin Medical School, from which I graduated in 1995.I completed my transitional internship year at Madigan Army Medical Center in 1996.I completed my anatomic and clinical pathology residency training program at Madigan Army Medical Center in the year 2000.Q. And then let's see, a fellowship in dermatopathology you did from 2004 to 2005; is that right? A. That is correct. Q. And what does fellowship training in dermatopathology entail? A. It entails looking at numerous skin biopsies. I believe it is more than 5,000 skin biopsies over the course of a year. It entails learning special techniques that are done only in dermatopathology, like directing immunofluorescence. It involves becoming, for someone of a pathologist background, becoming somewhat familiar with many of the common clinical presentations of skin disorders.If I was coming from a dermatology background, it would be learning a lot of general pathology techniques. But it's very concentrated in skin pathology. Q. So is it fair to call dermatopathology like a subspecialty within medicine? A. It is. Q. And are there other subspecialties within pathology as well? A. Pathology has a number of subspecialties. You can subspecialize in forensic pathology, pathology, hematopathology, pediatric pathology, cytopathology, etcetera, etcetera. You can specialize in a certain organ like breast pathology or GYN pathology, prostatic pathology. It goes on. Q. Do you hold an active medical license in any state? A. I do. Q. And where is that currently active? A. Maryland. Q. And are you -- do you hold any board certifications? A. I do. I have board certifications in anatomic and clinical pathology. And I've got a -- I might -- I might mix up the exact terminology, but it's a special designation for -- do you know what, if I look at my C.V. real quick, I can get the perfect terminology -- but it's a special certificate for board certification in dermatopathology issued by the American Board of Pathology and the American -- American Association of Dermatology. Q. Okay. A. So I'm board certified in anatomic pathology, clinical pathology, and dermatopathology. Q. Now, earlier I provided you with two documents. One was labeled Exhibit 3 and one was labeled Exhibit 54. Do you have that Exhibit 54 handy?A. I can pull it up on my computer. I have it available. (The Court Reporter marked Exhibit 54.)Q. And is that document marked as Exhibit 54 a reasonably current copy of your curriculum vitae? A. It is nearly up to date but not perfect. If I was applying for a job, I would put a little buffing on this, but it's basically up to date. Q. Okay. And you provided this to me via email maybe a week or two ago; right? A. Correct. (The Court Reporter marked Exhibit 3.) Q. Okay. I'd like to turn your attention to the other document, which I sent to you marked Exhibit 3. It's titled Consultation Report. Do you have that handy? A. I do. Q. What is that document? A. That is my pathologic report on a skin specimen that was sent to us from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Marion, Illinois. Q. And I guess I should back up. When you say "us", I assume you mean it was sent to The Joint Pathology Center; is that right? A. Sorry about that. Yes, I do mean it was sent to The Joint Pathology Center for a second opinion consultation. Q. And what is The Joint Pathology Center? A. We provide second opinion consultations to the Department of Defense and the VA Medical Centers over a wide variety of pathologic specimens. Q. So The Joint Pathology Center --The Joint Pathology Center's relationship with the VA Medical Center at Marion is one of sort of second opinion consultations, is that fair to say? A. That is fair, yes. Q. And in fact, this Exhibit 3 is addressed to Don Domenico at the VA Medical Center of Marion; is that right? A. Correct. Q. And this may sound like a very basic question, but was your review of the skin samples regarding Jack Carter, is it your understanding that this was part of his medical treatment at the VA in Marion? A. That's my understanding, yes. Q. So the purpose of your -- well, so what was the purpose of your report that went back to the VA Medical Center? Why did you send it back to the VA Medical Center? A. When we issue a report, it's to be used in the treatment of patients. We issue the diagnosis, and then the medical center will --the folks --the providers there will determine treatment based on our opinion. Q. So does this report, does it tell us when you would have received or performed your consultation on the samples for Mr. Carter? A. The report is dated the 14th of May. That's when I assigned the case out. I don't know exactly what day I received it, but we generally assign cases out within two or three days of receipt. So it would have been the middle of May.Q. Of what year? A. I'm sorry, 2018. Q. Now, starting at the top, there's a section called Diagnosis. What was the diagnosis that you rendered in this case? A. The overall diagnosis was melanoma. And then I gave a depth of invasion. And then I described the presence of regression. Q. And what was the depth of invasion you gave? A. 0.65 millimeters. Q. And below that I believe you described the samples that you received for this consult. What were those samples or materials that you received?A. We received -- pardon -- hematoxylin and eosin stain slides, which are routine stains. We received a kappa and lambda immunohistochemical set of stains. And we received two blocks.Q. And so when we talk about an individual slide, is a slide one section of skin, is it multiple sections of skin? How do those arrive to you? A. It varies. Some institution --well, it varies depending on institution and size of biopsy. If it's a very small biopsy, an institution may choose to mount several sections of that one biopsy on one slide.If it's a large biopsy, there may be only room for one set of sections per slide. Q. Does this report indicate to you what the case was here? A. It does not. Q. Okay. And then when you talk about blocks, what do you mean by blocks? A. Yeah, a block is a piece of tissue that has been formally fixed and is embedded in paraffin. And with that block, a laboratory is ready to make additional slides if necessary. Q. In this case, though, were you able to rely on the existing slides that had been transmitted to you? MR. FARROLL: Let me just object for nondisclosure. Go ahead.Q. (By Mr. Hanna) You can answer. A. Can you say the question again? Q. In this case, can you tell from your report if you relied on slides that were already prepared and sent to you, or if perhaps the JPC would have taken additional slides off the block, if you know? MR. FARROLL: Again, object that it's beyond the disclosure. Go ahead and answer, please.A. From the report, I would say that the JPC did not produce any additional slides because after it says what was received in consultation, I would have put in the sentence: "Additional sections are prepared from the tissue block." Q. (By Mr. Hanna) That's what you would have written if it had -- if additional slides had been cut; right? A. Correct. I always indicate whether additional slides have been cut or not. Q. Okay. Well, I can move into the body of your report. And I'm really just going to be asking you what you meant or what you intended to convey with most of this report. The first sentence sort of below the description of what you received talks about, you know, it says (Reading): Sections show an excision of skin...When you talk about sections, tell us again what that means.A. Those are the tissue sections that are mounted on the glass slides. Q. And in that first sentence of the body, what would you describe in terms of your observations of the sections of skin you received? A. First of all, that's an excision of skin and not a biopsy. And then I describe a very dense inflammatory infiltrate which obscures a melanocytic lesion that is partially visualized. Q. When you say that it is -- what significance does the word "dense" have in this report? A. I like to quantify the amount of inflammation. Sometimes I will say there's a sparse inflammatory infiltrate. What we're really doing here is giving a brief description of the histologic findings. Q. Now, when you say that inflammation obscures a partially visualized melanocytic proliferation, in layman's terms, what does that mean? A. It means that the inflammation is dense enough that it covers most of the melanocytic proliferation making it difficult to see the entire extent of it. Q. What significance does a melanocytic proliferation have if you're -- say you're looking for melanoma? MR. FARROLL: Again, let me just object. It goes beyond the disclosure, but go ahead.A. Could you please repeat the question? Q. (By Mr. Hanna) Sure. So what significance does your mention of a melanocytic proliferation have in the context of like trying to diagnose or find melanoma? MR. FARROLL: Same objection.Q. (By Mr. Hanna) You can answer. A. There are various types of melanocytic proliferations. One of them is melanoma. Q. So as you're examining these tissue samples for the purpose of making a diagnosis, are you looking at all of the different stains or are you relying on perhaps just one type of stain? MR. FARROLL: Object. It goes beyond disclosures. A. I would look at all of the stains that I have in front of me. Q. (By Mr. Hanna) And would there be any limitations? Like if you looked at the H&E slide in this case, would there be limitations to what the H&E slide could highlight for you in this case? MR. FARROLL: Object that it's beyond the disclosure.Q. (By Mr. Hanna) You can answer. A. I'm sorry, could you please just repeat the question to refresh it in my mind? Q. Sure. MR. HANNA: And Dan, I'll stipulate that you're going to make the same objection to this question as you have to a series of other questions that -- namely that you believe that these are beyond the scope of the disclosure.MR. FARROLL: So just to make sure that we're on the same page, and I don't want to obstruct any --the ability of the witness to answer your question, are you agreeing to give me a running objection to exceeds the scope of the disclosure? MR. HANNA: Yes, I'll note that that's a running objection. MR. FARROLL: So that I don't have to make it each time you ask the question?MR. HANNA: Yeah, I think that's -- I think that's fair. It seems like it's difficult for Dr. Royer to answer the question when it's interposed with an objection, so I think -MR. FARROLL: Sure. That's why I'm asking you ifyou'll agree to a running objection. MR. HANNA: Cool. So stipulate. MR. FARROLL: Okay, thank you.Q. (By Mr. Hanna) So Dr. Royer, I'm interested in the question of various stains and the limitations of various stains. So earlier you mentioned that one of these slides had something called an H&E stain.My question to you is, are there limitations to the usefulness to that H&E stain for the purposes of your diagnosis and report?A. Are you asking -MR. FARROLL: Just object that the question is vague, but go ahead.A. I was going to ask if you're asking in general or for this specific specimen? Q. (By Mr. Hanna) For this specific specimen. A. For this specific specimen, the obscuring inflammation made it challenging to evaluate the extent of the melanocytic proliferation. Q. And you're talking about when you're using the H&E slide; right? A. Correct. Q. Okay. So are there -- did you employ any other techniques to help you better identify the extent of the melanocytic proliferation? A. I used the special stain that had both MART-1 and Ki-67 marking it. That's an immunohistochemical stain I should add. Q. And what are those particular stains used for within dermatopathology? A. Well, this is one immunostain that has two markers on it. The MART-1 highlights the cytoplasm of melanocytes, both benign and malignant, and it will color them red. And the Ki-67 highlights cells that are in the proliferative process. It will highlight the nucleus brown.And when you have what looks like a red egg with a brown nucleus, you have a melanocyte that is in the proliferative cycle.Q. Now, the second sentence of this sort of largest paragraph talks about your use of that stain. It uses the term "florid" and "confluent growth". What do you mean by those terms? A. By "florid" I mean that the proliferation is exuberant, and by "confluent growth" I mean that there is back to back to back cellular growth of melanocytes along the basement membrane. Q. You also use the phrase "marked asymmetry." What does that --how is that significant to you? A. A benign melanocytic proliferation will be symmetric meaning that if you divide it in half, both sides will kind of be a mirror image of each other. Asymmetry is a feature that is concerning for malignancy. Q. So do I understand you correctly to say that these appearances, including florid and confluent growth, plus marked asymmetry are the characteristics that told you this was melanoma and not a benign melanocytic proliferation? A. Yes. Q. Your report also states that a portion of the lesion was regressing. Would you tell the Court what "regression" means in this report, this Exhibit 3?A. Regression in a melanoma is an indication that the body's immune system is active and actively fighting the melanoma. It means that the immune system is kind of destroying a portion of the melanoma. Q. Okay. I want to move down a little bit to the section that describes the tumor thickness. Do you see that part of your report? A. I do. Q. And would you tell the Court how you -- or, again, tell the Court at what thickness did you measure this melanoma and -- well, start with that, at what thickness did you measure melanoma? A. 0.65 millimeters.Q. And in parentheses you have the word "Breslow", which probably wouldn't mean anything to a layperson. Can you tell us what you intended to convey by using the word "Breslow" there?A. Well, we call it the Breslow depth. I'm sure it's named after someone named Breslow who came up with the idea that we should measure the thickness of a melanoma from the epidermal surface to its deepest portion of invasion. And the Breslow depth is associated -- depending on the depth, it's associated with different types of prognostic information. Q. So would you please tell the Court the technique that you used in this case to find a Breslow depth of .65 millimeters? A. I have, in my microscope, a small lens that has a scale on it. It's called an occular micrometer, and it helps us measure very small, very small measurements. Q. And how do you go about using that occular micrometer in this case to find the Breslow depth? A. I would line up the beginning part -- portion of that micrometer with what we call --it's the outer most surface of the skin called the stratum granulosum. And then line that up perpendicular to the skin surface. And line up the bottom portion of the melanoma with the scale. And there's a number right there that tells me the depth. Q. And how do you determine what the bottom portion of the melanoma is specific to this case? A. Specific to this case, I did the measurement on -MR. HANNA: We lost your audio. (At this time an off-the-record discussion was had.)A. Specific to this case, I utilized the immunohistochemical stain that had MART-1 and Ki-67 to determine the extent of invasion. Q. And why did you select that stain to perform your Breslow measurement in this case? A. Because I believed it adequately allowed me to visualize the melanocytes whereas they were mainly obscured on the routinely stain slides. Q. And did that decision -- or does that decision, in your view, comport with the standards applicable to dermatopathologists? A. We don't necessarily always measure on the immunohistochemical stain. We sometimes will measure on the routinely stain slides if we can visualize it adequately. We will not measure something that we are not confident is melanoma. So we use the tools we have. Q. Is it possible, though, that just the way that these sections were sliced, that perhaps you weren't looking at the deepest part of the melanoma when you measured the Breslow depth on the immunostains? A. I almost never say something is impossible in medicine. I think it's --I think it's highly improbable because the sections are 3-millimeter -- I'm sorry, error. The sections are 3 microns thick and they're taken essentially sequentially from the block. So they're very thin sections that are very close together. So absolutely it's possible. I think it's improbable because of the relative uniformity of very thin sections very close together.Q. Now, micron is what, a thousandth of a millimeter; is that correct? If you don't know, that's fine.A. I don't know that off the top of my head, so I'm going to not agree with you. I simply don't know. Q. But when you talk about 3 microns, is it your understanding that's an extraordinarily thin slice of tissue? A. Yes. Q. Another section of your report, just slightly down below, has the statement (Reading): Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are present and are brisk. Can you explain in lay terms what that section is intended to convey? A. We always, when we're evaluating a melanoma, mention the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, the presence or absence. And if they are present, whether they are brisk or non-brisk. And a brisk inflammatory infiltrate is one that essentially, by definition, covers and obscures the melanocytic proliferation. Q. So effectively the inflammation covers up and makes it difficult to see the melanocytes on a slide. Is that a fair description? MR. FARROLL: Objection, leading.Q. (By Mr. Hanna) You can answer. A. I'm sorry, can you -(The reporter read back the last question.) A. Yes. Q. (By Mr. Hanna) And can you explain the difference between brisk versus non-brisk? A. A non-brisk is one that either is scant, meaning very few lymphocytes, or one that only partially obscures the melanocytic proliferation. Q. Okay. In the kind of second to last paragraph, you mention -- you talk about the measurement of depth and that it's based only on the remaining melanocytic lesion visualized. What does that sentence mean? A. I put that in there because there are --the only thing that we measure is what we are confident is melanoma. We do not measure the features of regression that we see there. And the features that we look for, for a regressed melanoma, include inflammation, pigment incontinence, dermal fibrosis, meaning a little bit of dermal scarring, and epidermal thinning. Q. Okay. And in the next sentence you talk about the inflammatory component of the regression being deeper than what's measured. Can you tell the Court what you intend to convey by that sentence?A. It's very difficult to know, in a regressing melanoma, what the original depth of that melanoma is. So it's not knowable. In this instance, I was just commenting on the extent of the regression -- regressive changes. It's more of a histologic description that doesn't really figure into all of the prognostic features that are listed in that synoptic paragraph where everything is one line. Q. Okay. And the last paragraph you wrote, I believe, discusses how close the lesion comes to the outside of the specimen. Can you tell us about your observations described in the report on that point? A. The closest that the melanoma approached to the peripheral or lateral margin was 2 millimeters. Q. So the melanoma did not, as far as you could tell, cross outside of the lateral inked specimen margin? A. Correct. Q. And in your last sentence you state that you recommend re-excision to make sure that they got it all basically. Can you tell us about that last sentence, what it's meant to convey? MR. FARROLL: Let me just object to the question as presumes facts not in evidence.A. Can you just repeat the wording so I know exactly the wording of that question, please? Q. (By Mr. Hanna) Let me -- I'm going to withdraw that question and ask a new one. Will you just tell us what you intended to convey in the last sentence of your report?A. I intended to convey that re-excision of this lesion was indicated. Q. And by "indicated" you mean you recommend that? A. Yes. Q. Now Dr. Royer, when you wrote this report on or about May 14th, 2018, you didn't write it as part of any sort of litigation or dispute; is that accurate? MR. FARROLL: Let me just object to leading. A. I would say that is accurate. Q. (By Mr. Hanna) At some point did you become aware later that there was, in fact, litigation involving the treatment of this patient? A. Yes. Q. And did you have an opportunity to take a second look at this case? A. Yes. Q. And did that second look change your opinion or your views in any way from what is described in the report? A. No. Q. Okay. I'd like to take just a moment to consult my notes, but I think I'm just about finished with my questions and in a moment I'll pass you to Mr. Farroll, but give me just a moment to verify that I've looked at everything. MR. FARROLL: Could we go off the record a second? MR. HANNA: Sure. MR. FARROLL: I forgot to ask everybody's permission if I could record this just because I know we've got short turnaround time for the transcript, but we also have a trial coming up. So I actually hit "Record" and forgot to ask everybody's permission if I could record this.Do I have everybody's permission to record this? THE WITNESS: Yes. MR. HANNA: Yes. MR. FARROLL: Thank you. And I just wanted to make sure because if it wasnot -- if I did not get permission, I would have to delete the recording because, obviously, I need permission from everybody. So thank you for putting that on the record. (There was a brief recess.)Q. (By Mr. Hanna) Dr. Royer, we're back on the record. You're still under oath. Considering -- looking back at your statements in Exhibit 3, are your statements and opinions rendered in that report made to a reasonable degree of medical certainty?A. Yes. MR. HANNA: I have no further questions for you. Mr. Farroll, though, probably has several. CROSS-EXAMINATION QUESTIONS BY MR. FARROLL: Q. Good afternoon, Dr. Royer. This is my first time meeting you; is that right? A. It is. Q. It's not your first time talking to Mr. Hanna though, is it? A. It is not. Q. When did you first have a conversation with Mr. Hanna about Jack Carter's pathology? A. I don't recall that. Q. Do you have any email correspondence with him? A. I do. Let me see if I can pull up the earliest one and I will give you -- tell you that date. The earliest --no, no, no, I'm sorry, that's not correct.Q. Well, you didn't say anything yet, so. Either receipt or sent to you --or sent by you or sent to you.A. I'm going through my email as we speak. It appears that he first contacted me on November 23rd, 2021.Q. And was that the first contact you had with the Office of the United States Attorney relative to Jack Carter? A. Yes. Q. Did you have any contact with the VA Medical Center after your report was rendered in 2018 before November 23rd, 2021? A. No. Q. So the November 23rd, 2021 was the first occasion where you learned anything about Jack Carter after signing the report of May 14, 2018? A. Correct. Q. What did that email tell you, what did he say? A. It was a follow-up of a telephonic conversation we had on the same day, and it summarizes the issue regarding -- a different opinion from my own regarding the depth of invasion. Q. Okay. So Mr. Hanna told you that there was a different pathologist that offered a different opinion on depth of invasion? A. Yes. Q. And you two discussed that? A. That was what we discussed. Q. Did Mr. Hanna ask you to look at the pathology that day? A. He did. Q. And did you do that for him? A. I did not do it that day because -Q. When did you do that? A. The slides were not originally in our possession. I will see if I can pull up an email.It appears that I reviewed them on the 25th of January, 2022. Q. And did Mr. Hanna ask you to review those to assess the opinion of the other pathologist? A. I don't know his motivation in having me review that, whether it was to reassess my opinion or the other pathologist's opinion. I simply don't know. Q. Okay. So you took a look at the pathology with the idea that you wanted -- Mr. Hanna wanted you to test the opinion of the other pathologist? A. I -MR. HANNA: Objection, misstates his testimony, but subject to that you can answer.A. Again, I don't think I know why he wanted me to look at that to review it. I don't think -- I simply don't know. Q. (By Mr. Farroll) Well, let's go back. You told me that he explained to you that a different pathologist had measured the depth of invasion different than what you did? A. Yes. Q. And so he asked you to take another look? A. Yes. Q. So logic informs me that he's asking you to take a look to see if you agree or not with this other pathologist? A. You're asking me about his motivation and I'm not going to --I simply don't know. I can tell you I looked at it because I was concerned that I had made an error. Q. But you looked at it because he asked you to look at it? A. Yes. Q. And he asked you to look at it under his terms, and the terms that he used was because another pathologist had reached a different conclusion? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And so you looked at it again? A. I did. Q. And did he tell you the process that the other pathologist used to reach his conclusion, if you remember? A. He did, yes. Q. And what did he tell you? A. He informed me that the other pathologist measured the melanoma on the routinely stained H&E slide. Q. And so he was asking you to look at the H&E slide to see if you could reproduce that; isn't that right? A. He asked me to review the case, and I reviewed all of the slides. Q. Well, when he told you the other pathologist used a different slide to measure depth of invasion, and he wanted you to review it again, you understood that he wanted you to look at the H&E slide as well? A. Right. I looked at all of the slides. Q. Well, I'm not talking about all the slides. I'm talking about the H&E slide. You knew that he wanted you to look at the H&E slide? A. I can't know what is in his mind. Q. I'm not asking you what's in his mind. I'm asking you, he told you that he wanted you to look at the H&E slide, that's what you told me. Am I understanding that correctly?A. Let me see if I can get the exact wording of what he asked me to do. And I'm looking through my email now. It doesn't specify to look specifically at the H&E slide, but that would be part of reviewing the entire case.Q. Well, and again, I'm not asking necessarily about the content of the email, but the whole context of the discussion revolved around another pathologist who measured depth of invasion on the H&E slide. Do I have that part right?A. Yes. Q. Okay. And so he wanted you then to take another look? A. Yes. Q. And now, again, I don't think it takes a mind reader to understand that he wanted you to look at the H&E slide to assess the measurement that the other pathologist took on the H&E slide? MR. HANNA: Objection, asked and answered. Subject to that you can answer. A. I honestly was under the impression that we were looking at the entire case to make sure that the depth of invasion was correct, and part of that would be to look at the H&E slide. Q. (By Mr. Farroll) Okay. So your understanding is that he wanted you to look at the H&E slide to assess depth of invasion? MR. HANNA: Objection, misstates the testimony. A. Yes, the H&E slide would be reviewed, but the entire case was to be reviewed as well. Q. (By Mr. Farroll) Okay. And I'm not talking about the entire case. I'm just focused on the H&E slide. You understood he wanted you to you look at the H&E slide as part of the depth of invasion evaluation after the litigation was filed? A. Yes. Q. And he wanted you to look at that because he had told you he had a report from a different pathologist that looked at the H&E slide? A. Yes. Q. And so he was wanting to consult with you about the depth of invasion and the ability to do that from the H&E slide? A. Yes. Q. Okay. So you did that for him? A. Certainly, yes. Q. Okay. And you provided your opinion to him? A. Yes. Q. And you knew that he was going to take a deposition of that pathologist and cross-examine that pathologist with the information you would give him? MR. HANNA: It went on mute. MR. FARROLL: I'm sorry, I accidentally pushed a spacebar on my keyboard. I got to push that away.Q. (By Mr. Farroll) So at some point in time you knew that you were acting as his expert consultant to help him cross-examine another pathologist? MR. HANNA: Objection, misstates the testimony. MR. FARROLL: This is cross-examination. It's a leading question.Q. (By Mr. Farroll) Doctor, you understand the question? A. Can you please repeat it so I get the exact wording? Q. You understood that Mr. Hanna was speaking with you at some point in time because he was getting ready to cross-examine a pathologist? A. I recently became aware that this was going to trial and there would be depositions being taken, yes. Q. And you knew that he was using your expertise as a consultant to him to help him cross-examine a pathologist? A. Can you please clarify that? Q. Well, he was consulting with you for information about the science of pathology? A. Yes. Q. You were giving him information about melanocytic proliferation, depth of invasion, and all the other things that go along with diagnosing melanoma? A. Yes. Q. You were teaching him? A. One could put it that way. Q. Well, I mean, you were giving him information he didn't know? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And you knew that you were assisting him with information that was part of your expertise? A. Yes. Q. And you are employed by the government? A. I am. Q. And Mr. Hanna's employed by the government? A. That's my understanding, yes. Q. And you understood that the United States was a defendant in this case? A. Yes. Q. So the information that you were assisting Mr. Hanna with, that is not the kind of information that you would provide in the course of your job as a dermatopathologist at The Joint Pathology Center as a treating physician, is it? A. All of the information I provided him in the report is absolutely what I would do. The extraneous information is stuff that I would not be required to do because the person on the receiving end of the information is not asking for that degree of information. Q. Okay. I'm not sure that answered my question, so I'm going to come at it a slightly different way. When you were teaching Mr. Hanna about principles of pathology in preparation so he could cross-examine an expert in a lawsuit against the United States, your role at that point was no longer as a treating physician, was it?A. Correct. Q. Okay. Were you provided any deposition transcript of the other pathologist? A. I was not. Q. Were you provided with a summary of the testimony about depth of invasion? A. I was not. Q. You were provided with sufficient testimony about that to know that Dr. Robinson, or maybe you didn't know his name, looked at an H&E slide to determine that? A. Yes. Q. And did you tell Mr. Hanna what your opinion was of that testimony? A. It wasn't testimony. It was -- so I think that that's not -- I can't agree with what you said because I don't think it was testimony. Q. He told you what Dr. Robinson said about looking at depth of invasion from an H&E slide? A. Yes. Q. Okay. Well, I'm just telling you that's a summary from his testimony and reports. Okay? Did you tell him your opinion about another pathologist reviewing depth of invasion from an H&E slide?A. In this specific case, yes, I did. Q. Okay. Do you delete your emails? Or let me ask it this way: Did you delete any emails in connection with this case that you had with Mr. Hanna, either to or from him or his office? A. I have not deleted any emails. Q. How many -cd5ef557-f108-4539-a35c-8894d2e94e04 A. However, however, we, on the 1st of August, went from one email server to another, and in that crossover some of my emails were deleted in the process. I did not delete them personally, but I lost them in the crossover from one server to another. Q. And that was August 1st of 2022? A. August 1st of 2022. Q. Do you know if you lost any emails with respect to sent or received emails from -- to or from Adam Hanna? A. I did lose them, and I asked him subsequently to resend them so I had a record of them. Q. You asked Mr. Hanna to resend them to you? A. I did. Q. Are you at your computer now? A. I am. Q. How many emails did you receive from Mr. Hanna related to this lawsuit or Jack Carter? A. Give me one moment to count. It appears that I have seven emails from him. Q. And how many emails did you send to him? A. I don't know if I have that specific information. Q. Is that because of the lost emails in the email server transition? A. Yes, because I didn't ask him -- I couldn't have asked him to send emails that I sent him. Q. When did you first have an understanding that you might be a witness in this lawsuit? A. Please give me a moment to look that up. It looks like August 10th, 2022. Q. And why is it that you thought for the first time on August 10th, 2022 that you would be a witness in this lawsuit? A. I have an email asking if I would do a deposition for the trial. Q. Did you assist Mr. Hanna in answering any of the discovery materials in this case? MR. HANNA: Objection to the extent that Dr. Royer is a government employee. And being engaged in the defense of a lawsuit, both as government employees, the content of those communications is protected as attorney/client privilege material.MR. FARROLL: What's the basis for that privilege,what's the legal basis for that privilege? MR. HANNA: The attorney/client privilege. MR. FARROLL: You don't think that's waived byhaving him testify as a witness? MR. HANNA: No. No, I mean -MR. FARROLL: Offering expert opinions? MR. HANNA: No, no, no more than I would thinkthat communications between you and your client were waived by putting her on as a witness. I mean, when you're talking about government employees being involved in preparing discovery responses, I mean, that's at the core of the attorney/client privilege. Q. (By Mr. Farroll) Okay. Well, let me ask it this way. Without telling me what the communications were, did you assist with any discovery compliance in this case? A. Did you say discovery compliance? Q. Yes. Is that a term you understand? A. It is not. Q. Okay. So let me set the context for you and then I'll re-ask the question maybe a little differently. In the process of a lawsuit, the parties are permitted to ask written questions of each other. And then the parties are required to provide answers to those written questions, and those are called interrogatories.In the process of this case, are you aware whether you assisted in answering interrogatories to the government in any way? And again, I'm not asking for any particular communications, but whether that happened.A. Yes. Q. Okay. And when did that happen? A. May 19th, 2022. Q. And what happened on May 19th, 2022? A. I received an email from Mr. Hanna. Q. Can you tell me what discovery request was asked of you at that point in time? A. I was sent questions and responses for review and critique. Q. Okay. And you complied with that? A. I did. Q. Okay. Did you provide Mr. Hanna with any scientific materials in addition to your conversations about pathology principles, principles in diagnosing melanoma, or anything of that nature? MR. HANNA: Objection to the extent it calls forcommunications exchanged in the preparation of requestfor admissions. It's attorney/client privilege.MR. FARROLL: Well, I'm not asking aboutcommunications. I'm just asking if any of thatinformation, generic information that I described, wasprovided. Now, he may be asking a release for you tolet him answer or not to let him answer, but again, I'mnot asking for the content of any communications.MR. HANNA: Provided there's no content of communications in the answer, Dr. Royer, you can answer.Q. (By Mr. Farroll) So let me just re-ask it with all those conditions so you understand exactly what I'm asking for. Okay? A. Yes. Q. Without revealing the content of communications, can you tell me if you provided Mr. Hanna with any scientific materials related to pathology, pathology principles, diagnosis of melanoma, or anything like that? A. Other than what has previously been discussed, I cannot recall providing anything additional. Q. So basically the communications that you had, teaching him about these principles of pathology and melanoma that we previously discussed? A. Yes. Q. Okay. Did you reach any opinions on whether Dr. Lancaster, the pathologist who reviewed the original slides in 2016 at the Marion VA Medical Center, whether Dr. Lancaster's interpretation complied with the standard of care of a general pathologist? A. I would not like to speculate because I don't know if I'm qualified to state what the standard of care is or not. Q. Okay. He missed the diagnosis, you agree with that? A. Yes. Q. And when you say that you saw melanocytic proliferation, that was an atypical melanocytic proliferation, wasn't it? A. Yes, sir. Q. You did not say it was atypical in your report, did you? A. I did not say it was atypical. Q. Is there any reason why you did not say it was atypical in your report? A. If it's melanoma, then the presence or absence of atypia is not really needed to be commented on. Q. Well, you were trying to describe the appearance in the paragraph that we're looking at, isn't that true? A. Yes. Q. And describing the appearance of a melanocytic proliferation, one would want to describe it as typical or atypical? A. Not necessarily. Q. Well, if you're calling it melanoma, then are you saying one then just presumes it's atypical? A. Yes. Q. Okay. A. However, however, there are melanomas that have very minimal atypia. It's still a melanoma. The melanoma is the important part of the equation. The presence or absence of atypia is not really that important when it's already a melanoma. Q. Okay. But when you're describing what you see apart from the diagnostic line in a report, this would be more accurately described as atypical melanocytic proliferation, am I right? A. That would be fair. Q. Okay. When you reviewed the pathology material in 18, did you have the ability to review the electronic medical record for the veteran Jack Carter? A. I did not. Q. Did you know in 2018 that Dr. Lancaster had failed to make the diagnosis of melanoma in 2016? A. When I issued my report, yes, I did, at that point. Q. And how was it that you came to that information if you did not have the ability to look at the electronic medical record? A. Because when a specimen is submitted to us, they will also submit their original pathology report. So it's not -- it is a very small portion of the electronic medical record. And it is on paper, so it's not even electronic. Q. Would you agree that the H&E slides in this case that came to you from the Marion Veterans Administration Medical Center had strong signs of melanoma? A. No. Q. Would you agree that the Breslow depth of invasion is a measurement from the granular layer of the skin surface down to the most deep tumor cell in the underlying skin tissues? A. Yes. Q. Did you attempt to measure the Breslow depth on the H&E stain slides? A. I could not visualize the melanoma well enough to confidently measure on the H&E slide. Q. How many times did you review the pathology materials in this case? A. In total, including my very first review? Q. Well, let's talk about that. So let's include your very first review. A. I think only twice. Q. So once was on or about May 14 when you signed your report, and the other was January 25th? A. I would have to go back and double check the January 25th, but if that is correct, then yes, it would have been those two days. Q. Well, go ahead and check to make sure we've got that second date correct. A. I have January 25th, if that's what you said. Q. Yes. THE WITNESS: Okay. I'm going to have to switch positions because my phone is about to die and I need to plug it in.MR. FARROLL: Why don't we take a short break. I'm near finished and that will give you a chance to get set up with a charger. And then we'll come back on the record.THE WITNESS: I'm good to go right now. Q. (By Mr. Farroll) Do you know where the dual stain composed of the MART-1 and Ki-67 stains was performed? A. One second as I grab my notes. I do not know where it was performed. I know that it was not performed here.Q. I believe, if I remember this correctly, I believe there was some representation that the MART-1 and Ki-67 stains cannot be performed at the VA Medical Center in Marion, Illinois. Would you have any understanding of where those stains would be performed if they weren't performed there or at The Joint Pathology Center?A. I can only make an assumption. Q. Well, I don't know if we deal with assumptions, but what's your best guess given your work for the government? A. There are medical centers, and I don't know for a fact that the VA Medical Center in Marion is one of them. If they don't offer certain specialized testing, they can be sent to a commercial laboratory for performance. Q. Before your deposition started today, when was your most previous conversation with Mr. Hanna about your deposition testimony? A. Before today you asked? Q. Well, before we began today. I don't know if you talked to him in the morning today or whether that was yesterday, but when did you last discuss your deposition testimony with him? A. I spoke to him yesterday afternoon. Q. Okay. And that was in preparation for today? A. Yes. Q. And how long did that conversation take? A. I'm uncertain of that. Q. Well, I think you're probably a little more certain than I am. Was it more than a half hour, more than an hour? A. I think it was less than a half an hour, I think. Q. Have you ever testified in your role as a medical doctor before today? A. No. Q. Are you aware of the principles set forth by the College of American Pathology on being an expert witness in areas of pathology? A. Iam not. Q. So you didn't preview those before today? A. No. Q. Where are the slides now? A. I don't know for certain, but they are likely in our repository, the repository of The Joint Pathology Center. Q. Were you aware that the pathologist that reviewed the slides and reported a different depth of invasion also had them reviewed by a dermatopathologist? A. I read that, yes. Q. You read that. Where did you read that from? A. On an email. Q. Okay. So was it an attachment to the email or was it within the email? A. That was an attachment. Sorry for not being clear on that. Q. Okay. Can you pull -MR. HANNA: Dan, can I go off the record and tell you something just before your next question? MR. FARROLL: Sure. (At this time an off-the-record discussion was had.)Q. (By Mr. Farroll) So Doctor, we went off the record, and I understood in an off-the-record discussion with Mr. Hanna that you were provided some materials, and you heard that discussion I'm assuming? A. (Indicating.) Q. Do you have the reports of Dr. Robinson that he has sent to you? A. Yes. Q. Do you have them at your fingertips? A. I do. Q. Okay. I want to refer you to the report that is --I don't have it in front of my eyes right now, but I know it to be the -- I think it's a January -- actually, I'm going to get it right now. I think it's a January 18, 2022 report. Do you have that?A. Yes. Q. Now, Dr. Robinson created a report identifying the reported depth of invasion, and that he reviewed the case with one of his, he says "our", but one of his board certified dermatopathologists who calculated the depth of invasion using 0.9 millimeters using her intraocular micrometer, a standard tool for her practice of dermatopathology. Did you review that report in January of 2022 when it arrived in your email?A. Yes. Q. Now, for a pathologist to review a case with another pathologist in the office, you would agree that that is something that commonly happens just in the standard practice of pathology; right? A. Yes. Q. And it's the kind of thing that happens when somebody just wants a second look for whatever reason? A. Yes. Q. So for Mr. Robinson -- excuse me, for Dr. Robinson to ask a board certified dermatopathologist to review the case that he has just reviewed, that wouldn't strike you as unusual, would it? A. No. Q. Give me a second please. Did you have a conversation with Mr. Hanna between the time you received the January 18 report and the afternoon of January 21st, 2022?A. By conversation do you mean telephonic, email, or otherwise? Q. Any of the above. A. I don't recall having a telephonic, and I'm going to have to turn back to my computer to check to see the emails. Q. Feel free to do that. A. And the specific dates were what again? Q. After you received Dr. Robinson's January 18, 2022 report, and just -- let's just include January 21st within that. A. I will be right back. It appears that the next time after receiving this report that I contacted --or there was any contact between the two of us was the 25th of January.MR. FARROLL: Okay. I may be finished, but I want to just go off the record and take a short break and review my notes. Thanks. (There was a brief recess.)Q. (By Mr. Farroll) Dr. Royer, are you being paid apart from your regular government salary, I'm assuming you're on a government salary? A. I am. Q. Are you being paid apart from your government salary to testify today? A. No. Q. Were you being paid apart from your government salary when you were assisting Mr. Hanna with answering discovery in the case? A. No. Q. Were you being paid apart from your government salary when you were teaching Adam, Mr. Hanna, about principles of pathology and the diagnosis of malignant melanoma? A. No. Q. So all of your time spent assisting Mr. Hanna with the defense of this lawsuit you did as a government employee being paid your standard salary? A. That's correct. MR. FARROLL: Okay. I don't have anything further at this point, thank you. MR. HANNA: I don't have any further questions either. Dr. Royer, one of the things that we talked about, I believe, was the --well, when I say we talked about, I mean you and I, was the option that you have to read and sign your deposition in this case, and you indicated you plan to assert that right. And I think I told you that there would be a very tight turnaround on this in light of the trial set for next week.THE WITNESS: Right.MR. HANNA: But it's still your preference to readand sign the transcript in this case?THE WITNESS: If it's a legal document, I wouldreally prefer to be able to review it myself and makesure that it's correct.MR. HANNA: Understood. Understood. Okay. MR. FARROLL: Well, and I think to maybe add to that, you do understand that reading and signing does not give you an opportunity to change the substance of your testimony. It's really, in essence, to confirm that the court reporter was able to transcribe your testimony correctly, like if she misheard a word that you intended to use for example. MR. HANNA: Well, and further clarification to that, under the federal rules, you can actually change your testimony, but both the before and after would be shown on the errata sheet, so. MR. FARROLL: Oh, well. MR. HANNA: Yeah. So, I mean, you could change your testimony, but both versions would appear for all to see. So it's really intended, as Mr. Farroll said, you know, this is to correct if there was just a mistake in the transcription, but I don't entirely agree with what he said about what you could and couldn't change. THE WITNESS: Well, I'm just going to take you at face value right now and take a look at it. You're never too old to learn a new trick, so. MR. HANNA: Yeah, I learned that a while back. But anyway, we'll let you read and sign. His standard order. MR. FARROLL: Etrans.
