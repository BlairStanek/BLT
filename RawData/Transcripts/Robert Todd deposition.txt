Macina) and stating his address as 8100Oswego Road, Suite 210, Liverpool, New York 13090,was examined and testified as follows:EXAMINATIONBY MS. WEIS:Q. Good morning, Dr. Todd. My name isClaudine Weis.A. Good morning.Q. I'm an attorney from Wilson, Bave, Conboy,Cozza & Couzens. I'm going to be asking you somequestions today concerning your IME report datedJune 28th of 2021, which we have premarked I thinkas Defendant's Exhibit A.Do you have a copy of your report withyou?A. I do.Q. Okay. Good. Your CV indicates that youare a board certified neurologist; is that correct?A. That's correct.Q. And when did you become board certified?A. It should be on the CV. I don't know theexact date. I believe it was 2005. I would have tobring up my CV to give you the exact date.Q. That's okay. I'll take an approximation.You're correct. I do have a copy of your CV.You also list that you're board certifiedin pharmaceutical?A. I'm a registered -- well, I'm no longerregistered. I'm a licensed pharmacist in New YorkState.Q. Have you ever practiced as a pharmacist?A. Yes.Q. For what time period did you practice as apharmacist?A. I was licensed in 1973. I had to serve aninternship. So I graduated in 1972. I did aninternship. And you have to take boardexaminations. I passed all my boards February of73, and practiced as a registered pharmacist afterthat. And in 1989 I entered medical school, but Istill worked part time during medical schoolprobably right through 1993 when I graduated frommedical school. But I'm a little iffy about thatlast day. Maybe it was only 1992. I don't know. Idon't actually remember.Q. That's okay. I won't hold you to theexact year. But its been quite some time, correct?A. Since I was a practicing pharmacist andsold prescriptions, yes.Q. And are you currently employed?A. Yes.Q. What is your current position?A. I am the president of Robert E. Todd MDPC, which is located at 8100 Oswego Road, and I amthe sole member of an LLC called Forensic MedicalAssociates.Q. And how long has Forensic MedicalAssociates been in existence?A. At least since 2010 if I am rememberingcorrectly. Perhaps 2009. Not sure.Q. And affiliated with Forensic Medical -A. No, they're two Q. -- or is it A. Go ahead.Q. Is it an independent practice or somethingelse?A. It's my private practice of neurology, andit's separate and distinct from Forensic MedicalAssociates.Q. And how long has the private practice beenin existence?A. 1997 was when I entered private practice.Whether I formed the corporation in 1996, I'm not -you know, before I finished residency, I don'trecall exactly. I think probably 1997, though.Q. Are you affiliated with any particularhospital?A. I'm affiliated with three hospitals. I amaffiliated primarily with Crouse, C-R-O-U-S-E,Hospital in Syracuse. I'm also associated atSt. Joseph's Hospital in Syracuse, and with UpstateUniversity Hospital at Community General inSyracuse.Q. Do you still see, on a regular basis,private patients?A. I do.Q. And do you still see patients in arounding capacity as an attending physician ateither one of these three hospitals?A. No longer, no.Q. You no longer round in either one of thesethree hospitals?A. No.Q. When was the last time you had any privatepatients in a hospital facility?A. Probably at some point in -- it's hardbecause of COVID. For sure 2019. Probably 2020,but I don't recall. None in 2021. That I know forsure. Possibly 2020, for sure 2019. Can't dobetter than that.Q. That's fine. I will take your bestapproximation, Dr. Todd.A. Thank you.Q. Are either of these hospitals a teachinghospital?A. Yes.Q. Which one is a teaching hospital?A. Upstate University Hospital at CommunityGeneral, Crouse Hospital in St. Joseph's Hospitalalso have teaching facilities, but it's not inneurology per se. So they're all teachinghospitals.Q. Was Upstate University -- hospital from aneurologic stand point?A. Please repeat. You broke up.Q. Was Upstate University Hospital a teachinghospital as far as neurologic residents?A. Yes. Yeah.Q. Did it also have a dental program?A. I don't recall.Q. Did you oversee any of the residentphysicians at Upstate University Hospital?A. Back when I was --I trained there. Soback when I was training, yes, because I wasinvolved with teaching residents and medicalstudents as I went through training.Q. When you were going through training youwere going through training as a student yourself,correct?A. Yes. So yes, I trained at Upstate sincemedical school and residency, and so I went throughthe ranks and then you --you just --you gothrough.Q. Since you've been in private practice that is strange. I just heard myself echo ^ ? moretimes as if I'm in the Grand Canyon.A. We did too.MS. WEIS: Okay. Is there -- Lauren, doyou know if it's because the phone is on?THE REPORTER: It should -MR. SIVIN: Should we go on mute so -THE REPORTER: It shouldn't effect youraudio, I don't think. But when you were justspeaking after that echo, I think it was okay.MS. WEIS: All right. Does that seembetter?THE REPORTER: Yeah.MS. WEIS: Okay.Q. Going back to my question, Dr. Todd. Asan attending, you had privileges at UniversityHospital. Did you have any oversight over any otherresidents that were at that facility?A. That I recall, no.Q. In preparation of your report and your IMEof Plaintiff Chad Stanbro, did you review anydocuments?A. Yes.Q. Do you recall when --withdrawn.Who provided you those documents?A. Mr. Sivin, I believe or his office.Q. Do you still have those documents in yourpossession?A. Yes, they're digital. They're not paper,they're digital.Q. Do you recall when you received thosedocuments?A. No.Q. Did you have any conversations with EdSivin prior to your exam of Chad Stanbro?A. Yes.Q. Do you recall how many conversations youhad with Mr. Sivin prior to your physical of ChadStanbro?A. I didn't hear whatever somebody just said.Q. Okay. Do you recall how manyconversations you had with Mr. Sivin prior to yourexamination of Chad Stanbro?A. No.Q. Did you have any conversations with anyoneelse from Mr. Sivin's office?A. About Mr. Stanbro?Q. Yes.A. No. Not that I recall.Q. Are you able to estimate for me the amountof time you've spent during those conversation thatyou had with Mr. Sivin?A. Not as I sit here today, no.Q. Is it fair to say more than an hour?A. In an individual call or do you meancumulative way?Q. Just in its totality.A. I'm very confident that it was, but Ireally don't remember.Q. Okay. Is it fair to say it was more thanfive hours in its totality?A. I have this beeping here and I don't knowwhat that is.But anyway, I want to clarify the questionif I may. You're talking about prior to myreceiving the documents?Q. Prior to your examination of Chad Stanbro.A. Okay. So there's the examination andprior to that, no, I did not. I did not speak tohim for five hours.Q. Okay. There came a time that youperformed an examination of Chad Stanbro, correct?A. Yes.Q. Do you recall the date of thatexamination?A. I can look it up. Do I recall it? No. Ican look it up because it's likely to be in thisreport.Q. Did you review any materials inpreparation of your deposition today?A. Review for this deposition?Q. Yes.A. Yes.Q. What documents did you review inpreparation of your deposition today?A. Let's see. Certainly my report. Therewere --I don't know the right words for it, butdocuments from different individuals and formreports. There was a Dr. Collin, I believe. AndI'm looking for them as we speak. There was a Dr.Collin. There was a Dr. D-Y-M, Dym. And there wasa Dr. Eisig, E-I-S-I-G.I then reviewed my handwritten notes fromthe report. And then I went through some of thedeposition materials that I had been provided fromMr. Stanbro, that I recall. Probably other stuff.I just don't remember.Q. Okay. Are you able to estimate the amountof time you took to prepare for the depositiontoday?A. About seven and half hours.Q. Prior to reviewing the documents today,when was the last time you reviewed any of thesedocuments?A. So I didn't review these documents today.Q. Well, I asked you what did you review inpreparation for today's deposition?A. So is that what you're asking what -- whenwas the last time before I reviewed the documentsbefore today's deposition?Q. Deposition.A. Okay. I remember looking at Drs. Dym andEisig's reports several weeks ago. Because this hadbeen scheduled -- I'm really testing my memory. Ibelieve been scheduled or tentatively scheduled forJuly. So I simply looked at them around then inpreparation for this. And it was the receipt ofDr. Collins information that held me up, if Irecall. But to give you a better estimate, I reallydon't remember.Q. It's fair to say, though, that youreviewed the documents that are listed in yourreport prior to the IME of the plaintiff, correct?A. Those records? That's not a fairstatement, because some of those records came to meafter the examination. So all of the documents thatare listed there. So I examined him at some time inJanuary of this year. If my memory serves mebecause I didn't look it up. I can if you need toknow that date.Then there was other records came to me,and those were reviewed afterward and areincorporated into the report. And I did that afterI examined Mr. Stanbro.Q. Are you able, either based on yourhandwritten notes or your typewritten report, ableto tell me which records you received prior to hisexamination versus those records that came after hisexamination?A. As I sit here today, no.Q. Do you have any documents or records inyour office, either memos, e-mails, letters, orthings of that nature that would indicate whichrecords you had prior to the ^ ? IME, versus therecords you received after his exam?A. There's so much of an echo and thequestion was long, I didn't get it. Can you pleaserepeat it?MS. WEIS: Lauren, do you mind repeatingthe question?(The requested testimony was read back.)A. I imagine I do, but I'm not certain ofthat. But I imagine that that -- those recordswould be time stamped when I opened them. I openedthem after --no, I don't think there's a way tofigure that out.Q. Do you have any e-mails from Plaintiff orPlaintiff's law firm indicating the medical recordsthat were provided to you, either before theexamination or after the examination or somethingelse?A. I believe they went to, like, Dropbox orsome other place in the Cloud where you can leavefiles like that. I don't believe they're datestamped there that I could determine what came when.I don't think I could do that.Q. So its fair to say as you sit here today,you're not able to testify as to which medicalrecords you were provided before his IME in Januaryof 2021, correct?A. Well, I can probably look at the list andtell you that I believe --I believe and when I gotthem. For example, I believe that I have therecords from Westchester Medical Center. But youknow, I don't know. I don't think I can. No,you're right. I don't think I can do that.Q. Were you provided with any diagnosticfilms before his examination?A. I believe so. I don't recall.Q. Do you recall reviewing any X-rays beforehis examination?A. I don't recall.Q. Did you take any X-rays or MRIs or CATscans in your office at the time of his exam?A. No.Q. Do you recall how long your physical examof Mr. Stanbro took in January of 2021?A. It may be recorded in the note that weretaken.MS. WEIS: Mark, you provided Lauren withhis handwritten notes, too?MR. HEINZE: Yes.MS WEIS: Okay. Thank you.A. It appears to be 36 minutes if my math iscorrect.Q. And did that approximate 36 minutesencompass the entire time you were physicallypresent with Mr. Stanbro?A. Well, if you exclude walking him to thedoor and shaking his hand and, you know, good luck,things like that, yes. You know, but that wouldjust be amenities, not having anything to do withthe exam.Q. During the course of your exam, youperformed a range of motion testing on hisextremities, correct?A. Yes.Q. As well as his cervical spine?A. Well, I think only of his cervical spine.I have to look.Q. Let's take a look at your report that hasbeen marked as Defendant's Exhibit A. Do you havethat available Dr. Todd?A. My report?Q. Correct.A. Yes, I do.Q. Do you recall if the history that wasprovided to you by Plaintiff at the time of yourexam was verbal, written, or something else?A. I don't understand your question.Q. The history that was provided byPlaintiff, did he verbally communicate that to you,did he hand you any documents about the history orsomething else?A. He would have just told me. I would havequestioned him and he would have given the answersto the questions and it would have been written downby someone.Q. And who else was in the examination roomwith you at the time?A. I believe it was Gina Walters.Q. Is she in your employment?A. She is.Q. I'm going to look at what's been marked asDefense Exhibit B. It is handwritten notes on ayellow note pad. Do you have your handwritten notesavailable?A. I have the handwritten notes, yes.Q. Are you able to identify for me what's inExhibit B as a document that you generated?A. A document that was generated in myoffice, yes.Q. Do you know who generated this handwrittendocument?A. This was written by Gina Walters.Q. Is there any portions in this five pagedocument that is in your handwriting?A. Nothing that I see.Q. Other than this handwritten five pagedocument by Gina, did you take any handwrittennotes?A. No. None.Q. Did you audio record any of theexamination?A. No.Q. Did you video record any of theexamination?A. No.Q. Looking at your --looking at thehandwritten notes prepared by your assistant Gina,on the first page, lines 8 and 9, where it states,"Guards in the room during procedure; this onvideo," underlined. Do you see that?A. I do. I do.Q. Do you know where Gina obtained theinformation that guards were in the room during theprocedure and this was on video?A. No.Q. Do you know what video your assistant Ginais referring to?A. Do I know? No.Q. Did you come into possession of any videostaken of Mr. Stanbro?A. Yes.Q. Do you recall what that video withdrawn.Do you know who provided you with thatvideo?A. Mr. Sivin or someone in his office.Q. Do you know where that video was taken?A. Yes.Q. Where was the video taken?A. At Westchester Medical Center.Q. Do you know when the video was taken?A. Yes.Q. Did you review the video before examiningMr. Stanbro in January of 2021?A. I don't recall.Q. Do you know if your assistant Ginareviewed the video before Plaintiff's examination ofJanuary 2021?A. No.Q. When you reviewed the video, do you recallwhat the video depicted?A. Some of it, yes.Q. And what do you recall?A. That it was an outside hallway in theWestchester Medical Center.Q. Did any portion of the video that youreviewed show Plaintiff in a procedure room withguards?A. You're asking me two questions. So I wantto break it up for myself, is the camera was in thehallway. I did not see inside the room very far.So I did not see Mr. Stanbro that I recall. I sawguards go in and guards come out. That's what Irecall.Q. Okay. The information that is in thefirst paragraph of your handwritten --of Gina'shandwritten note, was that information that yourequested she write down?A. Is that information I requested what?Q. Gina to write down?A. No. I don't request her to writeanything. I'm interviewing the patient, she issitting behind me and I really don't see what'sshe's writing.Q. Do you review the document after she'sconcluded writing things down at the end of theexamination?A. Do you mean immediately?Q. Immediately after the examinationconcluded prior to writing your report or somethingelse?A. Well, I don't immediately review it, no,but within a short period of time. How long, Idon't know.Q. Can you estimate for me if you reviewedGina's handwritten notes within a day, a week, amonth, or something else after the examination wasconcluded?A. It would either have been that day, mostlikely that day, possibly the next.Q. I'm going to relay to you that yourexamination of Plaintiff took place on January 6,21.A. Yes.Q. Report that was provided to us, and ismarked as Defense Exhibit A, is dated June 28, 2021.Do you recall when you prepared this report?A. It was prepared in stages. So theexamination of -- would have been contemporaneouslyrecorded in the -- in the report. The record reviewand so forth took time because all the recordsweren't available and I had to wait for these tocome in before I could complete the report.Q. Looking through your 19 page report A. Yes.Q. -- are you able to state which part of thereport was prepared at which time?A. No.Q. Do you have any drafts of your report?A. No.Q. Do you have any indication whether thee-mail, handwritten notes, billing records, orthings of that type that would indicate the stagesof the report drafting?A. I don't think so. Not as I sit heretoday. I don't believe that I do, no.Q. Do you know when you prepared the physicalexamination portion of your report that is on pagessix, seven, eight, nine?A. The examination portion of the reportwould have been prepared at the time when I reviewedGina's notes. So that I would have sat and recordedit contemporaneously. And as I said earlier, thatday, evening, or the next day. But I don't recallwhich.Q. Do you still have a copy of the recordingthat you made contemporaneously with the examinationthat take place one or two days after you sawMr. Stanbro?A. What recording are you referring to?Q. You just testified that you performed thisportion of the report and that you recorded itcontemporaneously there a day or two after reviewingGina notes, correct?A. My misunderstanding. You said "recorded."I thought you meant, like, taped it or didsomething. You mean typed it? It's this report andI just -- as the report generates, it's the same -it's the same Word document that it gets documentedinto. So there's --I would have saved it wheneverI finished it, and as the records came in, I wouldwork on the report.Q. Did you dictate the physical examinationsummary?A. No.Q. Did you type it yourself or somethingelse?A. No. That would be typed by me personally.Q. So when you said "recorded," you didn'tmean by drag and speak or through a recordingprocess dictation manner or things of that?A. That's correct. I would have typewrittenit.Q. And as you sit here today, it's yourrecollection that you typed the examination portionof the exam within a day or two of seeingMr. Stanbro?A. Yes.Q. Referring you to page nine of your report.A. Yes.Q. This section listed as, "Range of Motionof the Cervical Spine."A. Yes.Q. How is it that you obtained the range ofmotion degrees during Plaintiff's examination?MS. ORTIZ: Claudine, if I couldinterrupt. Ed just said something in the chatthat he is not --he says, "No one can hearme," and to please stop. So I don't MS. WEIS: I'm sorry.MR. SIVIN: Thanks, Julie.MS. ORTIZ: Thank you.MS. WEIS: Well, while he figures thatout, I'm going to take a two minute break. Ijust need to run to the ladies' room.(A recess was taken.)2BY MS. WEIS:Q. Going back to Page 9 of your report.A. Yes.Q. How would you perform the range of motiontesting on Mr. Stanbro?A. I have an instrument that's called agoniometer. A goniometer is what in geometry, whatprotractor and you can measure an angle by movingthe device. So that it's --think about it likeit's two rulers, and one is, depending on what youwant to be your focus point, is one point staysstraight and you move the device as the patientmoves. In this case, their head/neck. So thedevice will then point to a number and then that'show that's reported there.Q. And I understand your exam took placeduring COVID time period.In a typical non-COVID time period, toobtain a range of motion testing from a patient,would you put your hands on the patient and move thebody part until their maximum range of motion wasachieved, or would you ask them to do it themselves,or something else?A. So when I would move their head, thatwould be passive range of motion. And I don't dothat ever, even in non-COVID times, because that's away you might hurt someone. So --at least from myperspective. So this is called active range ofmotion. So other than the device, I'm not touchingthe patient in any way. They're moving their head-- in this case, their neck --to the position.And I instruct them to actively move a body part -in this case, the neck --in a certain directionuntil it starts to hurt, while I measure it with theinstrument.Q. Is it fair to say then that you're relyingupon the patient to make the determination as towhen their maximum range of motion is achievedbefore they report pain; correct?A. Yes. It is an objective measurement of asubjective portion of the claimant.Q. With the medical records that you reviewedin preparation for or subsequent to Plaintiff'sexamination, did you review any physical therapyrecords?A. I don't recall.Q. Did Mr. Stanbro relay to you that heengaged in physical therapy?A. I don't recall.Q. Do you recall reviewing any records fromWestchester Medical Center?A. Yes.Q. Relative to Plaintiff's treatment at thefacility in August of 2018?A. Yes.Q. What records do you remember reviewing inAugust of 2018 from Westchester Medical Center?A. It would have been the -- his presentationon August 31st, 2018, to the Westchester MedicalCenter.Q. Was that his presentation to the emergencyroom, inpatient, dental clinic, or something else?A. So there would have been dental records, Ibelieve. I don't recall. I don't recall. I'mpretty confident that I saw the dental records, butI don't recall that. It certainly included hispresentation to the emergency room. That, I recall.Q. In reviewing your January 28, 2021 report,you list a fairly comprehensive list of medicalrecords. I'm going to -A. What date? Excuse me. What date did yousay?Q. Your January --your June 28, 2021.A. I thought you said January. I wasn'tsure. Okay. June. Yes.Q. June.A. Okay. Now, please repeat.Q. You list a fairly extensive list ofmedical records that you reviewed; correct?A. Yes.Q. I'm going to direct your attention to Pageof your report.A. Yes.Q. The section listed Westchester MedicalCenter.A. Yes.Q. In that section, you list that youreviewed the emergency department records; correct?A. Yes.Q. The hospitalization records; correct?A. Yes.Q. And radiology records; correct?A. Yes.Q. Do you list anywhere in that section thatyou reviewed the dental clinic records?A. Not that I see.Q. In the section of the documents that youreviewed, you also list various transcripts;correct?A. Yes.Q. Deposition transcript of Dr. Full, NursePagliaro, and Dr. Weber; correct?A. Yes.Q. Did you review any deposition transcriptsfrom a Correctional Officer Palou?A. I may have. I may have seen it after thisreport was generated. I don't recall.Q. Did you review any deposition transcriptof a doctor --a Correctional Officer Deal?A. I may have, but I don't recall.Q. Did you review a deposition transcript ofa Correctional Officer Leonardo?A. I may have, but I don't recall.Q. And the same question goes for thecorrectional officers, Landry and Torres?A. I may have, but I don't recall.Q. Do you recall reviewing the dental clinicrecords for August 31st, 2018, either prior toseeing Plaintiff in January or preparing a report inJune?A. I may have, yes.Q. Do you have an understanding as the typeof treatment that Plaintiff was receiving at thedental clinic on August 31st, 2018?A. On August 31st of 2018?Q. Yes, I'm sorry. Yes, August --Iapologize. August 31st, 2018.A. Do I recall reviewing those records onAugust 31, 2018, yes.Q. Do you recall the type of treatment he wasreceiving in the dental clinic on August 31st, 2018?A. Yes.Q. What type of treatment did he receive inthe dental clinic on August 31st, 2018?A. It was a treatment for TMJ Syndrome. Hehad displaced his jaw, as I recall, and thedisplacement -- the treatment was to make that to -I probably can't use the correct words. So if therewas some type of a procedure that was going to bedone on the jaw, and during that procedure it wasdiscovered that a screw had came loose or more thanone screw, and that that screw had to be --had tobe replaced, which was not part of the plannedprocedure.Q. During your training as a neurologist aswell as a licensed pharmacist, did you receive anydental training?A. Some but not a lot.Q. Was that during your time in medicalschool or somewhere else?A. Probably during medical school but moreduring residency.Q. Did any of that dental treatment involvereplacing screws or arch bars?A. No.Q. Have you ever treated any patients in yourprivate practice as to dental conditions? As adentist -A. I'm sorry? Say it again, please. Thelast -Q. As a dentist.A. As a dentist?Q. Yes.A. No, I never treated anyone as a dentist.I'm not a dentist.Q. Have you ever administered Versed, orFentanyl, or Propofol in an office setting forprocedures?A. In an office setting, the answer to yourquestion is, probably. Depends on what you considerto be an office setting. So in my own personaloffice, no.Q. Have you ever used on patients, Versed?A. Yes.Q. Have you ever used on patients, Fentanyl?A. Yes.Q. And have you ever used on patients, Versedand Fentanyl, during a procedure?A. Yes.Q. What types of procedures would you useVersed and Fentanyl on patients?A. For IV conscious sedation for a variety ofdifferent things. Some people can't get into theMRI as an example. So there would --there would betimes when you would --I would --use IV conscioussedation to help a patient complete that procedure.There would be times when a patient was going toundergo lumbar puncture, administration ofmedication, and so forth, where you would use IVconscious sedation of which Versed and Fentanylwould be used.Q. When you have used Versed and Fentanyl ina procedure, how long does it take for thoseanaesthetic agents to start to affect a patient?A. When used in combination; is that yourquestion?Q. Correct.A. A minute, maybe less. Depends on thedose.Q. When the administration of the IV Versedand Fentanyl is discontinued, how long does themedication remain in a patient's system?A. Which one?Q. When they're both administered together.A. They both have different half lives. Sothey would remain for different periods of time.Q. If both Versed and Fentanyl arediscontinued at the same time, which one of thoseanaesthetic agents would, in your words, their "halflife," expire first?A. Probably the Fentanyl. Depends on thedose.Q. Do you recall the dosing that wasadministered to Mr. Stanbro on August 31st, 2018, inthe dental clinic of Versed and Fentanyl?A. Yes.Q. How much Versed was administered?A. 8 milligrams.Q. How much Fentanyl was administered?A. 100 micrograms.Q. Do you know if the entire dose of Versedwas administered to Mr. Stanbro during the course ofhis procedure?A. As I sit here today, no.Q. Do you know if the entire amount of thehundred micrograms of Fentanyl was administered toMr. Stanbro during his procedure?A. As I sit here today, no. Excuse me. Ofthe 100 micrograms?Q. Yes.A. 100 micrograms.Q. And is that because it's administered in aparticular way? Is it an IV push, time traded, orsomething else?A. I guess I'm going to withdraw the answerof 100 micrograms. You pose an interestingquestion. I don't recall. I would have to look. Idon't recall.Q. Did Mr. Stanbro also receive any localadministration orally, Lidocaine injections, orthings of that nature?A. Local anaesthetic, my recollection is thathe did, but I don't know.Q. Did you review any dental clinic recordsthat took place prior to August 31st, 2018?A. I don't know, as I sit here today. Ibelieve that I did. I know that there were recordsin the reports that you sent me from Dr. Dym and/orDr. Eisig that enumerated those. And as I sit heretoday, what I'm recalling from those reviews andwhat I'm recalling from my own recording, from myown recollection of the records that I reviewed, Ican't --I can't separate those two in my head, no.Q. Fair enough.The summary of your June 28, 2021, report,is that after the administration of Versed andFentanyl, Mr. Stanbro experienced an adversereaction to the anaesthetic agent; correct?A. Could you tell me what page you're on?Q. It's my own summery. That's why I'masking.A. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I was lookingthrough my report because I had something that says"conclusions." And I'm -- where is that? So couldyou please repeat it? I'm sorry.MS. WEIS: Lauren, do you mind repeatingit?(The requested testimony was read back.)A. I don't know how to answer that question.If it's in my report, then yes. I don't --I don't-- where -- I'm kind of determined where you gotthat from, so I can --so if you could point it outto me where you made that summary, that would behelpful to me.Q. I will look for it. Page 3 of yourreport, fourth paragraph. And I quote: "Shortlyafter the procedure began, Chad Stanbro had what wasdescribed as an adverse reaction to the anesthesia.That resulted in agitation and belligerent,aggressive behavior."Do you see that statement?A. Yes, I do. That's from a DOCCS medicalrecord that I referenced, Number 3, on the bottom ofthat page. So those aren't my words. Those aretaken from the DOCCS record.Q. And your footnote, Number 3, states,"DOCCS medical records, Stanbro 42/313," correct?A. That's correct.Q. Are you referring to a page number out ofa 313 page packet?A. Exactly.Q. So that statement, which I read and iscontained in Paragraph 4 of your report, is thatyour opinion, someone else's opinion, or somethingelse?A. That's my --since it's not in quotes anditalics I can't be certain that I quoted itdirectly, but it's from those medical records andit's a summary of what I -- what I read, I presume.Q. I'm sorry. You said that you werepresuming?A. That's what I presume, is that Isummarized that there, because I didn't put it inquotes or italics. If I were quoting, it would bemy practice to put it in quotes and italics.Q. Mr. Stanbro was undergoing a relatively for lack of a better word --painful procedure onAugust 31st, 2018; correct?A. I'm not a dentist. I don't know whetherthat would be a painful procedure or not.Q. Have you had dental procedures performedbefore?A. Yes.Q. Have you had the need for localanaesthetics?A. For local, like, Novocaine?Q. Yes.A. Yes.Q. Have you ever required conscience sedationfor any of your procedures?A. I believe when I had the --my wisdomteeth taken out, which is (indiscernible), I believethat they did give me something. In fact, I'm veryconfident of it.Q. Okay. Other than the summary that youpresume you read in the DOCCS records that he had anadverse reaction to the anesthesia which caused himto agitated, belligerent, and aggressive, are youaware of any other reasons that Mr. Stanbro couldhave acted out in that manner during his August 31stprocedure?MR. SIVIN: Objection to the form, but youcan answer. Go ahead.A. So when you say "acted out," what do youmean by that?Q. Well, he acted out in agitation or wasbelligerent or he was aggressive.A. I guess there's probably any number ofreasons that could have been.Q. What reasons?A. Well, he could have had an adversereaction to the anesthesia as they, you know, asthey pose there. They didn't describe, that Irecall, what adverse reaction he had had. So Iguess that would be the likely answer to this,because that's what somebody reported. And as I sithere today, I don't recall who said that.Q. Could pain also have been a reason why heexperienced agitation?A. I think he said that when he was givinghis history. He said he could feel the procedure.He could feel the procedure happening. I'm takingthis from the yellow notes that Gina reported, notfrom my note. But she didn't write down the word"pain." So he felt panicky as he started to comeout of it, is what I have written here.Q. Did you review Mr. Stanbro's depositiontestimony?A. Which didn't --did he have more than one?I'm not certain.Q. He did. Did you review all of hisdeposition transcripts, one, or something else?A. I don't recall. I know that there weremore than one, or at least I thought I knew therewere more than one, but that would have been a whilesince I've reviewed those.Q. You didn't review them in preparation foryour deposition testimony today?A. His entire depositions?Q. Correct.A. I did not.Q. Did you review Dr. Weber's depositiontestimony prior to your appearance today?A. I guess I'm confused over the question.So I want to back up to Chad's. I reviewed hisdepositions. I don't know when I did it. Ireviewed --I think you said Dr. Weber. So I didreview Dr. Weber's deposition, but I don't recallwhen I did it.Q. Do you recall, during your review ofeither one of those witnesses' testimonies, that Mr.Stanbro told Dr. Weber to stop the procedure?A. I think I do, but I don't --as I'msitting here today, I don't -- I can't say forcertain.Q. Do you recall, in your review of eitherwitnesses', Dr. Weber's or Mr. Stanbro's depositiontestimonies, that the procedure was aborted becauseof Plaintiff's pain complaints?A. I recall seeing that in either Dr. Dym orDr. Eisig's report. Yes, that would have been, Ibelieve, not in a deposition but in a report, andtheir recording of that, the way that they typed itup.Q. Are you aware, based on your review of themedical records that you were provided, that Mr.Stanbro received Versed and Fentanyl prior toAugust 31st of 2018?A. Yes.Q. And are you aware as to whether or notwhen he was administered Versed and Fentanyl onthose occasions, whether or not he was agitated,belligerent, or exhibited aggressive behavior?A. I don't recall that, no.Q. Have you ever provided an expert opinionwhere the patient was in the control and custody ofthe Department of Corrections?A. Yes.Q. How many times have you provided experttestimony of a patient who was in the control andcustody of the Department of Corrections?A. I don't know.Q. Do you have an understanding with areasonable degree of medical certainty what thestandard of care is for the treatment of a dentalpatient in a clinical setting?A. For a dental patient, no. I'm not goingto offer an opinion on dental care.THE REPORTER: Could you --I'm sorry. Ididn't get the last part of that answer.THE WITNESS: I'm not going to give anopinion on dental care.Q. And that dental care also includes theadministration of conscious sedation in a clinicalsetting; correct?MR. SIVIN: Objection to the form. Youcan answer.A. I think they're two separate things.Q. Have you ever administered conscioussedation on a dental patient?A. I interpret your question to mean, have Iever administered it as part of dental care, no.Q. During the course of your examination oryour review of the records that were provided to youby Mr. Sivin, did Mr. Stanbro tell you that he stoodup during the course of the procedure and took aswing or a punch at Dr. Weber?A. I don't recall that, no.Q. Did Mr. Stanbro tell you during the courseof your examination with him that he took a swing ora punch on one of the correction officer?A. I don't recall that, no.Q. Did Mr. Stanbro tell you, or did youreview in any of the documents that were provided toyou, that he kicked one of the correction officers?A. That I recall, no.Q. And that these actions took place in theprocedure room when the dental procedure wasaborted?A. Did --are you asking me if Stanbro toldme that? I'm missing -Q. Or did you review -- I know. They'restarting to mow outside my window.During your examination of him or thereview of the records that were provided to you, didhe explain to you that he kicked one of thecorrection officers in the procedure room?MR. SIVIN: Objection to form. You cananswer.A. Just one second. Excuse me. Pardon me.No, he did not that I recall.Q. Did Mr. Stanbro tell you, or in a reviewof your records, that when the procedure wasaborted, that he was sitting on the floor uprightagainst one of the chairs?A. I don't know that he used the words thathe was sitting on the floor against one of thechairs. I have that he told us he was on the floor,yes.Q. And referring you back to your June 28,21, report, and I'll find the section for you. Ishould have written down the page numbers when Itook my notes. But it refers to physical therapy.Page 8 of 19. First sentence, "He tried physicaltherapy, but is no longer participating in that."A. Did you say Page 8 of 19?Q. Yes.A. Well, I see it now. Yes. "He triedphysical therapy, but is no longer participating inthat." Yes, I see that.Q. Do you know when Mr. Stanbro took part inphysical therapy?A. Could you please repeat that? I wastalking at the same time. Sorry.Q. Do you know when Mr. Stanbro took part inphysical therapy?A. My recollection is that he went to a rehabcenter after his surgery. I don't know if he isreferring to that, or if he went to out-patientphysical therapy.Q. Do you know what type of physical therapyhe received?A. Do I know, as I sit here today, no.Q. Do you agree that physical therapy isvital to regain presurgical status?A. Physical therapy is vital, in his case, topresurgical status, yes.Q. Can we agree that a patient who is nolonger partaking in physical therapy can result innot achieving therapeutic goals of full or near fullrecovery?A. No.Q. And why not?A. There's a condition that calledplateauing. And so in medical cases, the physicaltherapy and rehabilitation are paid for by someinsurance company or some outside source, and youneed to provide information on a regular basis withregard to gain that is being made by a patient;otherwise, physical therapy is stopped because theyhave plateaued or reached maximum medicalimprovement.Q. To your knowledge, based on the medicalrecords that you received, did Plaintiff engage in asufficient length of time for physical therapy tohave reached maximum medical improvement, in youropinion?A. I don't recall.Q. Based on the medical records that youreceived or the information conveyed to you byPlaintiff, do you have an opinion whether or not thephysical therapy he engaged in was sufficient enoughto have plateaued, in your words?A. I don't --I don't recall the physicaltherapy or rehabilitation records to be able tooffer that answer.Q. To your knowledge, was Plaintiff ever onany type of pain medication after his release fromthe Department of Corrections' custody?A. So released on parole? I'm not sure thatI understand that question.Q. Okay. I'll -- you're correct. I'llwithdraw the question.When you examined Plaintiff in January of21, was he on any medication?A. No. I think he said he was not.Q. Did he convey to you that he was on anypain medication as a result -- withdrawn.Is the contention of Mr. Stanbro that hesustained an injury on August 31st, 2018; correct?A. Yes.Q. What was that injury he alleged occurred?A. Spinal cord injury.Q. Did Mr. Stanbro convey to you that, at anypoint in time after August 31st, 2018, that he tookany pain medication for his spinal cord injury?A. No.Q. Did Mr. Stanbro convey to you or did youreview any records that indicated that he wasfollowing with a pain management physician afterAugust 31st of 2018?A. I don't recall.Q. Do you recall Mr. Stanbro conveying to youor you reviewing any medical records that wereprovided that reflected treatment by an outsideneurologist after August 31st of 2018?A. I don't recall.Q. Is it fair to state that the pursuit ofoutside treatment after surgery for a spinal cordinjury would improve or benefit Mr. Stanbro'scondition, as you found it in January of 2021?A. It would depend on when after the surgeryyou're talking about.Q. Let's say, within three months of surgery.A. Yes. I believe that he would havereceived medical care in that period of time.Q. Is it fair to say within six months ofsurgery?A. Possibly. The -- that would depend. It'sdifficult in this case because he's under the care,custody, and control of the Department ofCorrections, and so it's very likely he had a lot ofmedical care while he was there that I just don'trecall.Q. Do you know the type of surgery Plaintiffunderwent on September 1st of 2018?A. Yes.Q. What type of surgery did he undergo?A. It was an anterior cervical discectomywith fusion, called ACDF.Q. Have you, as a board certifiedneurologist, ever performed an anterior cervicaldiscectomy with fusion?A. No. I am not a surgeon.Q. I'm going to refer your attention toPage 10 and 11 of your June 28, 2021 report. I'malso --withdrawn.Do you recall reviewing in the medicalrecords that were provided to you, the August 31,18, sedation record?A. Do I recall it, as I sit here today, Irecall reviewing it, yes.Q. When was the last time that you reviewedthe August 31st, 2018, sedation record in theWestchester Medical Center Dental Clinic chart?A. I don't know.Q. Did you review it in preparation for yourdeposition today?A. No, not that I recall.Q. Do you know what time Mr. Stanbro enteredthe dental clinic room for his procedure?A. I believe it's written down.Q. (Indiscernible.)A. No.THE REPORTER: I'm sorry. I didn't getthat question, Ms. Weis.MS. WEIS: He said, "No."THE REPORTER: I think your question gotcut off. So the last answer I received was, "Ibelieve it's written down."Q. Do you know, as you sit here today, whattime Mr. Stanbro entered the dental clinic room forthe procedure?A. The answer, no.Q. Do you know what time the consciencesedation was administered?A. As I sit here today, no.Q. Do you recall reviewing the Aldrete scoredocument that was prepared by Dr. John Full?A. Yes.Q. Do you know who Dr. John Full is?A. Personally, no.Q. Do you know who he is in context to thislitigation?A. I believe he was a dental resident workingat the clinic under the attending dentist Dr. Weber.Q. The administration of conscience sedationthat was given on August 31st, 2018, was Versed andFentanyl; correct?A. Yes.Q. Do you have an understanding, as you sithere today, that Plaintiff received Versed andFentanyl prior to August 31st, 2018; correct?A. Yes.Q. And in your review of the records, did yousee any adverse reaction to Versed or Fentanyl priorto August 31st, 2018?A. No.Q. Have you ever administered an Aldretescore in the course of your practice as aneurologist?A. No.Q. Do you have an understanding, as we sithere today, whether the Aldrete score isadministered at the conclusion of an examination orprocedure, or when a patient walks out the procedureroom door, or something else?A. It's at the time of discharge following aprocedure.Q. In your opinion, is that when a patient isstill in the procedure room, in a recovery room, thewaiting room, or somewhere else?A. It would be when they are discharged fromthe care of the person that is completing theprocedure.Q. Why would it not be done when a patient istaken out of conscience sedation?A. Please repeat it.MS. WEIS: Lauren, may I have the questionread back, please.(The requested testimony was read back.)A. Because when the --it takes time for theactual sedation to wear off. So that if you stoppedIV sedation, that doesn't mean that they aren'tstill sedated.Q. Is it fair to say that, when a procedureis aborted, such as the procedure in this case onAugust 31st, 2018, and a patient is able to standup, he's conscious?MR. SIVIN: Objection to the form. Goahead.A. Well, it depends on what your definitionof consciousness is. So are they awake, alert, andattentive? The answer to that is no. Are theyawake? Probably, yes.Q. If a physician never administered anAldrete score, is it fair to say that, if a patientis telling the treatment team to "stop," that he isconscious?A. No.Q. If a patient is standing up and swingingpunches on medical staff and correction officers,are they alert, and awake, and attentive in youropinion?A. Not necessarily, no.Q. If a patient is kicking a correctionofficer at the conclusion of an aborted procedure,is it fair to say that he's alert, awake, andattentive?A. No.Q. Is it fair to say that he has goodrespiration if he is reported to have been yellingand screaming?A. The two are two separate things. So no,that wouldn't be fair.Q. Well, in your report, on Page 11 -6Page 10, it states: "Respiration; able to take adeep breath and cough."Is it fair to say that, when a patient isyelling and screaming, that patient is able to takea deep breath?A. No.Q. Is it fair to say that a patient who isstanding up, swinging punches, kicking and movingaround of his own accord is conscious and fullyawake?A. No.Q. It's your opinion that patient is stillunder the effects of conscious sedation?A. It could be, yes.Q. And is it also your opinion that a patientwho is standing up, swinging punches, kicking,yelling and screaming does not have an activitylevel of being able to move all four extremitiesvoluntarily or on command?A. The answer to that I think would be -- Ican't quite recall how you asked the question, butit would seem to me that they were able to move allfour extremities. That's going to be my answer,because I can't remember whether the answer would beyes or no, the way you formed the question. Butyes, it would seem to me that they would be able tomove all four extremities voluntarily, yes.Q. Is it fair to say that based on therecords that you reviewed, with the understandingthat you don't recall reviewing many of thecorrection officers' deposition testimonies, that atleast when Plaintiff became aggressive, that it wasunderstanding for Dr. Full to leave the room for hissafety?A. I believe Dr. Weber instructed Dr. Full toleave the operatory, yeah.Q. And it's fair to say, at that time, it'sbecause Plaintiff was acting in such a manner ofstanding up and yelling and swinging punches andknocking equipment over the floor; correct?MR. SIVIN: Well, I'm going to object tothe extent that I think that it's beyond thescope of the doctor's expertise. But havingsaid that, you can go ahead.A. I don't why Dr. Weber decided to telleverybody to leave the room. That's certainly onereason.Q. It's also, at that time, that thecorrection officers entered the room; correct?A. It's also the time that the correctionofficers entered the room? Was that the question?Q. Correct.A. I believe so, yes. Going to the video, Ibelieve that Full walked out and the correction -no, actually, no. The correction officers went in,and that was when Full and the other staff were toldto leave. I think that that's the way I rememberit.Q. Having not performed an Aldrete scorebefore in your practice as a neurologist, do youhave an understanding with a reasonable degree ofmedical certainty whether there was a continuingobligation to preform an Aldrete score either at theconclusion of the procedure or when the patientleaves the operatory?THE REPORTER: I'm sorry. Ms. Weis -A. Yes. At the time of discharge. That'swhen it should be completed.Q. In a situation such as this, when Dr. Fullhad to leave the operatory for his safety at theinstruction of the physician and the correctionofficer, is it fair to say that he is able to relyon his observations prior to exiting the room?A. No.Q. And why is that?A. Because he doesn't know what happenedafter he left the room and what may have transpired.We know that the --well, let me change that.I testified to you that I did not believethat he was fully conscious. So he wasn't fullyconscious at that time, so if he wasn't fullyconscious at that time, that would not be the timeto rely upon your observations from 33 minutesearlier.Q. And how do you know that he made hisobservations 33 minutes earlier?A. I believe that that's when Dr. Weber toldhim to leave the room and I believe that's when thescore was taken, when Dr. Full recorded his score.Q. So it's your opinion that a second Aldretescore should have been performed when the patientleft the operatory?A. It's my opinion that the Aldrete scoreshould have been performed at the time of discharge.Q. So it's your opinion that a second Aldretescore should have been performed when the patientleft the operatory, correct?A. I don't --so if the Aldrete score issupposed to be completed at the time of discharge,I'm not saying the first one that's reported wasactually a legitimate Aldrete score. That's mytestimony.Q. And is it the standard of care toperformed Aldrete score in a dental clinic settingwhen a patient is being discharged, in your opinion?A. Well, I'm not going to testify about thestandard of care of dental care. I will on thetiming of when the Aldrete score should be completedis at the time of discharge.And at some point, I would like to take alittle break.Q. Okay. Almost done.A. Okay. I'm good.Q. Is it fair to state that, after Dr. Weberinstructed Dr. Full to exit the room, and thecorrection officers came into the room, that patientwas then under the control of the correctionofficers at that time?A. No.MS. ORTIZ: Objection to the form.A. Well, excuse me.Q. And why is that?A. Because they objected to the form, am Iallowed to answer whoever objected?MS. ORTIZ: Yes, that's just for therecord. I am just noting my objection. Sorryabout that.THE WITNESS: No, no, that's okay. Ijust -- I don't want to do something I'm notsupposed to do.A. So I think your question was, why is itthat he didn't change to the care and custody of theguards. Do I have that correct, at least the sumand substance?Q. Correct.A. Okay. The reason is, is that Dr. Weberwas still in the room, and Dr. Weber was still --hewas still under Dr. Weber's care, control, andcustody. Because the procedure may have beenaborted, he was still under the influence of the IVconscious sedation that he had been administered.Q. Have you prepared any supplementalreports?A. No.Q. Have you performed any exams ofMr. Stanbro since January of 2021?A. No.Q. Are you able to estimate for me whatpercentage of your practice is private practiceversus your consulting practice?A. I think that I can give you a reasonableguess. I see approximately in a typical week, oneday a week I spend seeing private patients, and theremainder of the week I spend doing this type ofwork. Not always expert medical witness, butindependent medical examinations and things likethat. So I typically testify that I do -- 80percent is involved with Forensic MedicalAssociates, and 20 percent is with Robert E. ToddMD, PC.Q. Are you able to estimate for me how thatpercent with your consulting business translatesinto an annual income?A. I'm not --I think I understand thequestion. Let me tell you what I think you'reasking me. How much income do I derive fromForensic Medical Associates; is that correct?Q. Yes. It's -- I'm sure it's not -6A. 100 percent.Q. -- an easy question.A. Okay. 100 percent. No income from RobertE. Todd MD, PC.Q. You do the private practice on a volunteerbasis?A. No. The practice makes money; I justdon't derive income from it. It pays otherexpenses.Q. And are you able to estimate for me whatyour annual income is from the consulting business?A. My personal. I file jointly with my wifeso can I -- can I consolidate that for you? Wouldthat be fair?Q. I'm not interested in the income from yourwife --well, I withdraw that.Does your wife work with you in theconsulting practice?A. Yes. She's a full-time employee.Q. Okay. Other than Gina --or withdrawn.Is Gina your wife?A. No. No.Q. Okay. Other than Gina, your wife, andyourself, do you have any other employees?A. Not that are --not that are full-timeemployees. On occasion I'll have people that willwork for me adjunctly. And there's a name for whatyou pay them with. It's -- the accountant takescare of it. You send them a --you send them a format the send of the year, but you don't pull backtaxes and social security.Q. An independent contractor?A. Say it again.Q. An independent contractor?A. Yeah, like, an independent contractor. Onoccasion, yes.Q. Are you able to estimate for me, sinceyour wife works with you, what your annual income isthat is derived from the consulting practice?A. Yes. I can give you my best guess. Theaccountant completes our tax forms. So in 2020 I'mthinking our combined household income was about0,000. That's a wild guess, but it's in thatneighborhood.Q. That's fine. On an average year, can youestimate for me the number of cases that you reviewin your consulting practice?A. So that's --well, the answer is no. Ican probably try and determine that. So this issort of an unusual case because this is one that isgoing to require trial testimony. The greatmajority of my practice is with independentexaminations with regard to workers' compensation,no fault, and things like that that don't requireexpert testimony. You see them once; you write areport, and on occasion, you go to trial or adeposition.And I still didn't answer the questionreally; did I? Well, let me answer it this way: Itry to do between three and four IMEs a week. Sothose three or four IMEs a week would translate toabout 150, if we look three, and then paid off timefor Christmas and stuff like that, when I'm notdoing well. And maybe a dozen cases like this in ayear where there would be more to do. Is that areasonable guess --or that's my reasonable guess.Is that a reasonable answer for you?Q. That's perfectly fine, Dr. Todd. Thankyou.A. Okay. Thank you.MS. WEIS: Thank you. I have no otherquestions.THE WITNESS: Can we take that littlebreak right now?MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA: Yes. I wouldlike to take that break, and then we will startquestioning in a few minutes. Good?THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Say it again.MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA: We'll take abreak, and then we'll start my questioning.Five minutes?THE WITNESS: Yeah, five minutes. Soundsgreat.(A recess was taken.)EXAMINATIONBY MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA:Q. Dr. Todd, my name is Iolanda Francavilla.Very nice to meet you today. I represent Dr. FrankWeber in this lawsuit.A. All right.Q. A lot of my questioning overlapped withClaudine's, so I'm just --it might come out oforder. I'm just going to go through what I hadprepared and what doesn't overlap, because we don'twant to ask you the same questions. I will --if Ido, I apologize. I will try not to, to the best ofmy ability.A. Sounds great to me.Q. Dr. Todd, how much are you being paid orthis deposition?A. For the deposition, $7,500.Q. Okay. And how much were you paid to datefor this case?A. I don't know off the top of my head.Q. Well, have you been paid something to datefor this case?A. Yes.Q. And that came from Plaintiff's counsel?A. Yes.Q. And I know you said you have a --forgiveme --I don't know if it's a PC or PLLC where you dothis expert work.Do you go through any other agencies inorder to get expert work, or is it just through yourown?A. Well, I get referrals from agencies, sothere are a number of different places that mayrefer cases to me. But those are typically workers'compensation cases and no fault cases. Not caseslike this.Q. Okay. And what percentage of yourbusiness would you say comes from outside referrals?A. Probably the --I need to qualify that.They all come from outside referrals, so like Mr.Sivin is an outside referral to me. So they alldid, but I don't think that's what you're reallyasking me.Q. I meant from, like you said, from otheragencies?A. So from those agencies Q. Yeah.A. -- like the great majority of my casescome from agencies. Because I don't -- they have tocome from some place. So for IMEs, for workers'compensation, they have to come from some place, andthat's the great majority of my cases.Q. Okay.A. In excess of 90 percent.Q. Okay. Thank you.Have you ever worked on a use of forcecase before?A. Yes.Q. Was it similar with a similar sort ofinjury to this case?A. It was an injury, but I don't remember -9I really can't even --I don't remember what theactual injuries were.Q. And maybe I should have said this beforethat question, was it one other use of force case,or do you know how many other use of force cases?A. I don't know. It's a number and it's arelatively small number. It would be as many asfive. But no more I don't believe. It's hard overso many years to remember so many cases. It reallyis.Q. Right. And then I believe you testifiedthat you became board certificate in neurologyaround '05 or '06; is that correct?A. Yeah.Q. And is the exam comprised of a writtenportion and oral portion?A. Yeah, there's three parts to it, yes.Q. Okay. And how many times did you take thevarious parts of the exam before you passed?A. Best guess because I don't recall. It's along time ago. So the written portion was the one Ihad the most difficulty with. So I took that -- Ibelieve I passed on my third time. So I believe Itook it twice. Passed on time number three.Then there's a component where you wouldexamine a live patient. So that would be one of thethree parts that I passed the first time. And thenthe third part is a combination of adult andpediatric cases. And I think I passed it on thesecond -- that one I'm not hundred percent sure of.It might have been third. I don't recall.Q. Okay. Thank you.A. You're welcome. It was the third time. Ijust --I'm going through it in my head. So thatpart that was the adult and the pediatric was thethird time. Because I remember now. I had -Q. What is that --what is -- is that like aphysical exam or is that just discussing cases or?A. Yes. It's like they -- it's like whatthey call "vignettes." And so they -- that they -that there's a booklet that they have and there's acase that you read out loud. You yourself read outloud. It's brief, like, maybe three paragraphs.And then they ask you certain questions about it.And if I'm remembering it correctly, there were fourcases for pediatric, and four cases for adults, andeach one took 15 minutes. That's, kind of, what Iremember.Q. Okay. All right. Now, I'm looking atyour --well, actually, I probably --well,withdrawn.Is it -- do you recall or is it fair tosay that the video that --of the back hallway thatyou described seeing is not time stamped?A. Did I testify to that, no.Q. No, do you recall it being time stamped?A. Do I recall it being time stamped? Itmust have been because I record --I record timesright on it. So it had to be time stamped. It hadto be.Q. Would you have recorded the time, like,the length in the video? Let's say, this occurredat -- I'm just speaking by example --at one hourinto the video, not exactly that that was a certaintime.A. No. I would say it was an exact -- well,understanding that it's whatever time was in thecamera itself was the -- what I call the "clocktime." So at 1:31:53 -- I'm looking at it rightnow -- so at 1:00 p.m., 31 minutes, and 53 secondstime stamped on that video.Q. Would the video have started exactly at:00 if it was one hour and 38 seconds long?A. No. That's not what I'm saying. I'msaying it was on the clock. The time --if you werelooking at the clock, what time is it now? 1:31 andseconds.Q. Right. So what time does the video start?A. Oh, I don't recall.Q. Right. And A. Well, let me change that. I believe thatit's a 24/7 video. I really --or whatever that itsays video and they gave me a segment of -Q. Right. If you have it in front of you,would you be able to tell me what time it starts?A. I think so, yeah.Q. If you could do that.A. Say --do it now?Q. Would you be able at this point? If youhad it up in front of you --if you have the videoup in front of you.A. No, it's remote. I can connect remotely.But it's at -- it's at --here I'm at home down atmy office. And so I think that -Q. Okay. We have very limited time, so Idon't want to --I don't want to waste time. But Ijust wanted to try to figure that out, because onthe video that I have, it starts at 00 and mind ^ ?it was just at the length --like it was an hour and, or an hour and 40 minutes, or not necessarilythe 1:40 or 1:38 p.m.? Like -A. You may be right. Maybe I'm wrong.Q. Right. I A. I don't know. I assume that.Q. Because you know that you know at 1:38:33,he is wheeled out or something like that, but Iwasn't sure that that was the exact time.A. Yeah, I -- now that you pose it that way,maybe you're right, and I'm wrong. Maybe that isn'tthe time; it's just the time on the video, that if Iwanted to look at it in testimony, that I can bringit up, and I go, "Oh, there it is, 1:31:53." And Ithink I assumed, when you asked the question, thatthat was the time on, you know, like, the clocktime, but maybe you're right. Maybe it's just theelapsed time. I don't know.Q. My video starts at 00. But --so that's--I just wanted to throw that out there, that not-- possibly not necessarily looking at a timestamped video.Okay. So I want to go back to the Aldretescore. And I'm not a doctor. So I don't know ifI'm saying that right, if it's "AL-dret-EE" or -I'm not sure. But that's what I'll call it, ifthat's okay.A. That's fair enough.Q. Okay. So you say that there is no --inyour report, you say that there is spontaneousmovement noted on the video; is that correct?A. That's correct.Q. So we don't see into the operatory; isthat correct?A. Very little. Like there's some -- there'ssome angled view through there that I tried tofigure out what it was. Like the door's open andevery once in a while you can see something going onin there. So you can see people opening up thedoor, and there looked like maybe it was a device totake blood pressure or something. I really don'tknow what I --I don't remember what I saw. Iremember seeing into the room, though.Q. We see little glimpses, right? Littlepieces of -- when we can get into that angle, maybethe doctor is doing something, or -- we don't reallysee the patient much, however; is that correct?A. I think that is a -- very fair, yes.Q. Okay. So the portion where the patient where Mr. Stanbro is wheeled out from the operatoryinto the hallway, would you agree with me to saythat it is fair to say that that was maybeseconds or less? That little -- that littlepart?A. If I --I don't recall, but I thought itwas longer than that.Q. Okay.A. But I don't recall.Q. In your --in your --it wasn't a longperiod of time?A. I think that's fair.Q. Okay. So is it possible that in thoseseconds, those limited seconds that we saw Plaintiffon the video, that he didn't make any spontaneousmovement purposely? If that makes any sense to you,or do you want me to rephrase it ^ ??A. I can tell you that the time that he wason the video, he didn't move, yeah.Q. Right. So -- but what I'm trying to sayis that, is it possible that he was able to makemovement, but we just didn't see it because it wassuch a limited time that he was actually on thescreen?A. Didn't appear that way to me. What I what I remember is he looked like he was unconsciousto me. His head was slung back and his eyes wereclosed, if I am remembering this correctly.Q. Okay. So --but do you know for certainthat he couldn't move any extremities just by theappearance of his head and eyes?A. Could I -- could I --I couldn't say oneway or another to that, because I didn't observe it.So the typical way that you would do it, would be toif you didn't notice them moving it, that --so thatwould be voluntarily -- that they would have to doit on command. So that would be part of the score.So if you don't see them moving, you would say,"Move your arms. Move your legs."Q. Right, but they didn't perform any sort ofexam in those --in those few -A. They didn't preform an exam.Q. -- seconds that we saw him on the screen.So -A. They didn't -9Q. -- we don't know whether he was coming in-- I'm sorry. And I --we didn't say this at thebeginning. Totally my fault. Let's just try not tospeak over one another so that Lauren could get aclean record. If you could just wait for me tofinish my question and then I will do the same.So I think what I was saying is that hewasn't in those few seconds told to move his arms orlegs. He just didn't move his arms or legs in thattime that we saw him on the screen?A. Yeah, I don't like the words, "a fewseconds." During -- I'll --I'll -Q. During the time that we saw him on thescreen?A. Yeah, he did not move his arms or his legsduring that time, correct.Q. Okay. Now I want to go back to the pointin which the Aldrete score is taken. Would youagree with me that it's -- there's no --I guessI'll withdraw that.I'll say based on the amount of drugsgiven to a patient, does the Aldrete score timingdiffer?A. Yes.Q. Okay. So would you agree that someone whowas given a relatively small dose of Versed andFentanyl one time only at the beginning of aprocedure, would have their Aldrete score takenbefore someone who had, maybe, like, a surgery,like, the gallbladder removal or something that had,like, conscious -- like, that had -- was being givendrugs the entire time?A. They would not use IV conscious sedationduring a gallbladder thing, so I think that you needto think of -Q. I'm not a doctor. So A. No, no I Q. -- I like to think that I am, but I'm not.So just something longer. I just used that --Ijust pulled that out of, you know, nowhere. Butjust --I -- do you want me to rephrase or do youknow where I'm going?A. I know where you're going.Q. Okay.A. And I -- and you are okay with me tryingto give you an answer to that, I will.Q. Yeah. Go ahead.A. So when you -- the --I've got to thinkabout the question, how to phrase it. Just give mea second.When you're given doses of thesemedications, you need to wait until the patient hasfully recovered from the doses of the medicationsbefore you can perform the score. And that's whereI think we diverge. So -- and you used the words,"relatively low doses." I don't know where you gotthat from that these were relatively low doses.So I'm not -- I'm not agreeing to thatterm. But I believe that the factor that he was inthe room, given IV sedation, you had to wait untilthat had worn off until you could do the Aldretescore. You couldn't -- you couldn't make a --anassumption that 33 minutes earlier while he's stillin that room, that he wasn't under the affects ofthe anesthesia.MS. WEIS: Okay. I'm going to move tostrike portions that are nonresponsive.A. I'm sorry.Q. But that -- that's not -- nothing to dowith you.So what I want to say is, in a patientthat was given these types of drugs, like I said,and I'm not going to say -- I'll just say it. In apatient that was given these types of drugs in thoseamounts and just one time at the beginning of theprocedure, would they have their Aldrete score takenquicker than someone who was given drugs throughouta procedure, IV sedation, throughout, like,continuously?It's just a yes or no, if you can. If youcan't, you could just say, "I can't."A. I can't give you a "yes" or a "no" tothat. Because the length of the procedure and thelength of the --of the time that they give him theIV is --is -- doesn't matter. You do it at thetime that you're discharged irrespective of thelength of the procedure.Q. Okay. So let's go back to that.So now we know that --I know you said youdidn't -- you may not have reviewed the WestchesterMedical Center Dental Clinic records because it'snot in your report; is that correct?A. I believe, based on a different questionthat was asked to me, that those dental clinicreports were in something that came from DOCCS. SoI was asked a question, I don't remember what thenature of that question was, but dental clinicrecords were referred to in there, and so I'mthinking the dental clinic records were not from thedental clinic, but part of the DOCCS documents.Q. But you may have seen the records, justnot sure from the dental clinic; maybe in the formof some other sort of disclosure?A. That's exactly right.Q. Okay. So you were --you did in somereview of your records find out that Plaintiff toldDr. Weber to stop the procedure, and the procedurewas aborted, and that, subsequently, he took a swingat Dr. Weber; correct?A. That's what's being alleged, yes.Q. Is it not reasonable for a doctor to, atthat point, when prison -- when corrections officerscome rushing into the room for the care and custodyof that person, to be transferred to the correctionsofficers?A. Not when he was still under the affects ofanesthesia.Q. Now how long does it take for Versed andFentanyl in those doses to -- for the affects towear off?A. While you shouldn't drive for 24 hours,would be the recommendation. And so I use that asthe ground point. In terms of how long would theylast, probably 40 minutes or so, with a half life ofan hour and a half to two and a half hours, giventhe combination, the affects could last a little bitlonger.Q. Okay. So --but you don't -- you don'tpractice oral surgery, right, Doctor?A. Say it again, please?Q. You don't practice oral surgery, right?A. No, I didn't --I wasn't saying anythingabout oral surgery -Q. No. No. That was just my question.A. Sedation.Q. Correct. So on Page 18 of your report,you have your conclusions there. And in the firstparagraph, last sentence -- just tell me when you'rethere.A. I'm --"conclusions." Yep. Go ahead.Q. You have, "This injury occurred as aconsequence of blunt trauma to the neck while in thecare, custody, and control of The New York StateDepartment of Corrections and CommunitySupervision." Is that correct?A. Yes. That's what it says.Q. So in your opinion, in your report, youconcluded that he was under the care, custody, andcontrol of DOCCS at that point; is that correct?A. When the injury occurred, he was undertheir care, custody, and control, yes.Q. So is it fair to say that the care,custody, and control of the Plaintiff stopped withDr. Weber stopped when the correction officers camein? Or at least it looks like that according toyour report.MS. ORTIZ: Objection. You can answer.A. No, that's when I'm talking specificallyto the blunt trauma there.Q. Okay. So at one point in this --and wedon't see it. We don't see the Plaintiff in thevideo. We've all --I think you've testifiedclearly to that. At some point while the Plaintiffwas in the operatory, the care, custody, and controlwent over to The New York State Department ofCorrections; is that correct?A. Well, that's a -- parts of it did, yes.So he hadn't completed his --he was still in theoperatory, so Dr. Weber was still responsible forthe medical component of -- I'll change that to thedental component --of what had occurred there.Even though the procedure was aborted, it didn'tchange the fact that he had administered IV sedationand so forth.Q. Right. But he was in there for a while;right?A. Do you mean Mr. Stanbro?Q. Yes.A. Yes.Q. So just the fact of him being in theoperatory, does that mean he was under Dr. Weber'scare and control just because he was physicallysitting in the operatory?MR. SIVIN: Just note my --just note myobjection. I think you're asking the doctor totestify to essentially legal conclusions.Having said that, to the extent that the doctorcan answer that, you know, go ahead.MS. WEIS: I'm asking from, like, from thedoctor, like, from being under the care andcontrol of the doctor. I don't want him tomake a legal conclusion, because that's notwhat he's here for.But --I'm sorry. Can you read back thelast question, Lauren?(The requested testimony was read back.)A. So you're --what happens is that --andthe only --I can only do it by way of example. Isthat if you're in the middle of a procedure, andsomebody strikes out at you and you have to call forassistance, that doesn't discharge yourresponsibility for completing what you started. Andso --so that --I don't think you care, but ithappens to me that, you know, people do getbelligerent when you're doing things to them, andyou might sometimes need to call for security tocome and help you. That doesn't say, "Well, nowthey're under their control." It means they'repartially responsible, and you're still -- I'm stillresponsible for that patient. I hadn't dischargedhim yet. He hadn't been discharged from my care.Q. Okay. So then why did you in yourconclusions say that the injury occurred when theplaintiff was in the care, custody, and control ofDOCCS?A. Because that's when the blunt traumaoccurred.Q. Okay. So I keep go back to this question.So you're saying --is it fair to say that at onepoint control went over to DOCCS from Dr. Weber?MS. ORTIZ: Objection.A. No.Q. Okay.A. Excuse me. No.Q. Okay. Now, the video --would you agreewith me when I say that the video depicts Dr. Weberand Dr. Full initially, kind of, going to thedoorway when the corrections officers come in?A. Do you mean they're inside the room, theycome to the door, or do you mean go outside into thehall?Q. When the corrections officers come inthey, kind of, make their way to the door, kind of,you know, watching what's going on inside?A. I --so I want to make sure that Iunderstand. They're on the outside looking in; isthat what you're saying?Q. Yeah, like, in the doorway. Not, like,ten feet away, but not really kind of in the room.Kind of just, like, maybe even under the door frame?A. Yeah, I think that that's what the video-- what the video depicts.Q. And then the video --is it fair to saythat the video depicts Dr. Full and Dr. Weber at onepoint going back in the room, coming back out, goingin, you know, kind of, leaving for a little andwatching. Going into the room a few times; is thatfair to say?A. I don't know Full went in. I do believeWeber went in. He may have. I just don't recall.Q. Okay. So could it be that the Aldretescore was taken at one of the times that Dr. Webercame back into the room and not initially at thepoint where the procedure was aborted?A. Dr. Full did the Aldrete score.Q. Right. But would it be -- well, let's putit this way. Was it reasonable from Dr. Full tobase the Aldrete score on what Dr. Weber told him?A. No.Q. Why is that?A. It -- because it's hearsay.Q. So it's not okay -- it's not reasonablefor one doctor to rely on what another supervisingdoctor would say? Supervising attending?A. Well, that would not be -- that would notbe acceptable in my opinion. No. If you observedit you should write it down. You're the --you'rethe observer.Q. So if that's in your opinion, you'resaying. But it wouldn't be reasonable medically fora resident to rely on what his supervising attendingtold him?A. To -- and then to reduce it to writing andsign your -- and sign your name to a legal document;no, that would not be reasonable.Q. Okay. And let's say Dr. Full did go backin the room at some point. Is it possible that hetook the Aldrete score then?A. Anything is possible.MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA: Okay. I'mjust looking at my notes. Like I said, I don'twant to overlap with Claudine.If -- Claudine, are you still there? Idon't see you on the camera.I just want to make sure we didn't loseher.MS. WEIS: I am.MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA: Oh, there youare. There you are.MS. WEIS: Yeah. Check your computere-mail.MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA: Just onesecond, everybody. Off the record for onesecond.(An off-the-record discussion was held.)MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA: Actually, I'mjust going to -- I'll let you guys go and thenI'll follow-up if I need to.MS. ORTIZ: Got it. All right, Mark.I'll take it from here.EXAMINATIONBY MS. ORTIZ:Q. Hello, Dr. Todd. My name is Julia Ortiz.I represent the OAG Defendants in this matter. AndI'm going to try not to cover what anybody else hascovered and I'm going to try to speed this up asquickly as possible.I know that there was some discussionearlier with Ms. Weis with respect to you're prep totoday's deposition. But I -- maybe I wasn't payingattention, I just kind of wanted to narrow it down alittle bit. When did you prep for this deposition?A. I have to stop and think about that. Ibegan on Friday. I did Friday, some Saturday, andsome Sunday, and this is Monday.Q. Okay. Great. And I A. I actually did a little bit --I'm sorry.I actually did a little bit this morning, too.Q. Okay. Great.On Friday, what, if anything, did you doto prepare for today's deposition?A. I don't recall.Q. Did you review documents on Friday?A. Yes.Q. What documents did you review, if any, onFriday?A. I don't recall.Q. Do you know how long you revieweddocuments on Friday?A. No.Q. Okay. On Saturday, what, if anything, didyou review in preparation for today's deposition?A. I reviewed documents on Saturday, and Ibelieve I had a conversation with Mr. Sivin onSaturday.Q. Okay. What documents did you review onSaturday in preparation for today's deposition?A. I don't recall.Q. Do you recall how much time you spentreviewing those documents on Saturday in preparationfor today's deposition?A. No, I didn't. I have it written down, butit's not here.Q. Okay. And where did you have it writtendown?A. My office.Q. Is that your normal custom and practice towrite down the amount of time you spent whenreviewing and preparing for a deposition?A. Yes.Q. Okay. And how do you document that? Isit just on a note pad, is it in a program, orsomething else?A. Well, typically I would -- typically Iwould record it on a piece of paper, like, eight andhalf sheet of paper.Q. And when you record it, is itcontemporaneous when you're doing the review orsomething else?A. It would be when I --when I finish. So Ispent some time. If I got interrupted, I wouldwrite down, you know, how long I had been on it.You know, ten minutes, whatever it was. And thenrecord it. It should be a cumulative thing. Idon't say, "On this day I spent this much time." Iaccumulate the time and then I go, give me a littlebit of time, and usually I put a start date and astop date.Q. Okay. So as we sit here, what is yourindependent recollection of the amount of time youspent reviewing documents? Just an approximate isfine.A. Reviewing documents and excluding thediscussion with Mr. Sivin, about six hours, maybesix and a half.Q. And as we sit here at this moment, youdon't recall what documents you spent approximatelysix and a half hours reviewing on Saturday?A. Specific documents, no.Q. Okay. And the conversation that you hadwith Mr. Sivin on Saturday, how long was thatconversation?A. At least an hour. Probably a little bitlonger. I have it recorded, but not with me.Q. Okay. And you indicated that you preppedan Sunday, as well.What, if anything, did you do on Sunday inpreparation for today's deposition?A. I had a five-minute conversation withMr. Sivin, and then the rest of the time was spentlooking over my documents. But which ones, youknow, some of the things I looked over two and threetimes. So trying to get a flavor of what it was,and -- but to tell you, "I reviewed this document,that," I don't --I really don't recall.Q. And in the notes that you kept, that youhave at your office that were kept after -withdrawn.And in the notes that you just testifiedto with respect to the time you that spent onreviewing, would they itemized which documents youwere reviewing on which day?A. No.Q. Okay. And you indicated you spent sometime today in preparation for today's deposition.What, if anything, did you do inpreparation for today?A. Looked back over the -- my report. And Ilooked over the things from the two doctors, Dr. -the three doctors: Collin; Dr. D-Y-M, I think hisname is; and Eisig, E-I-S-I-G, I think. But it wasjust brief. You know, like, trying to -- not a -it didn't -- I did not spend a lot of time today onthat.Q. All right. You jumped to my nextquestion.How much time did you spend today withrespect to reviewing the reports?A. 30 minutes, maybe. I -Q. So do you recall if any time on Fridaythat you reviewed the reports that you reviewed thismorning?A. Could you please repeat that? I didn'tget it.Q. I'm sorry.On Friday, do you recall whether or notyou reviewed your report as well as the otherreports that you reviewed today?A. I don't know.Q. And same question, but for Saturday?A. I don't recall.Q. And same question, but for Sunday?A. I don't recall.Q. Besides reviewing the documents that youdon't recall in detail in reviewing as well as thetwo conversations that you had with Mr. Sivin, priorto today, have you had any other conversations withrespect to anyone in preparation for today'sdeposition?MR. SIVIN: Objection to the form. Youcan answer.A. Other than you folks, no. I talked to noone.Q. Okay. And aside from this case, have youever been retained by Sivin and Miller to testify asan expert in other cases?A. Yes.Q. How many times?A. Once.Q. Can you recall what year that was?A. 2020.Q. And was it -- sorry.A. Let me add a little something. It mayhave started in 2019; I'm not -- I'm not 100 percentsure.Q. Okay. That's fair. And do you recallwhether or not it was a case similar to this one inthat it was an allegation about the use of forceresulting in an injury?A. It was, yes.Q. And do you recall the injury in that casethat you were retained for in 2019-2020?A. Not that I would be comfortable testifyingto. If you would like my --what I think it was,I'm happy to give you that. But I don't want toswear to it under oath.Q. That's fine. I don't want you to guess.So if you had an independent recollection, thatwould have been fine.And I don't know if this was asked, and ifit was, I apologize: When did you first startyou're expert practice; was that in 2010?A. Either 2009 or 2010, when I --when Iformed the corporation. I had done this work priorto that, but I did it under the umbrella of RobertE. Todd MD, PC.Q. Okay. And at any point from when youpresented expert testimony, have you ever beendisqualified as an expert witness?A. Never, to my knowledge.Q. And in you're practice as a neurologist,have you ever been the subject of disciplinaryproceedings?A. Never.Q. And I know there were conversations withrespect to how the forensic practice is broken up.So forgive me, because I just want to make sure thatmy notes are correct.There's a portion, if my memory serves mecorrectly, that you testified that involved doingcases for IME, and workers' comp, and no-fault?A. Yes.Q. And how much --what percentage of thatwork is done in comparison to the work we're doingtoday as an expert witness?A. So you're talking about a number of cases?Q. Or percentage. Whatever is easier foryou. I just need an approximate, if you have it.A. Probably 90 percent or more is that typeof work.Q. So then it's fair to say 10 percent wouldbe this type of work, being retained as an expert toprovide testimony and report?A. Less than 10 percent, yes.Q. And in you're practice -- with thepercent of the practice, do you charge an hourlyrate, or is that a flat fee as well?A. Can you -- and I don't understand thatquestion.Q. How are you paid with respect to the otherpercent of the practice, with respect to theworkers' comp cases and the IMEs? Is that a flatrate, is it hourly, is it something else?A. It's a combination. I have a flat ratefor IMEs, and that includes a certain amount ofrecord review, and if you go over the record reviewthen it changes over to the hourly rate.Q. And if it changes to the hourly rate, whatis the hourly rate that you charge?A. I just raised my rates. So I'm going totell you both sets. Up until September the 15th ofthis year, it was $600 an hour. Increased my rateson September the 15th for new cases. So I'm stillbilling Sivin and Miller at $600, but I increased itfor new cases to 750.Q. Okay. All right. Thank you.Now, I'm going to direct you're attentionto what we're here for today. And forgive me, Iwent to law school, not medical school, so I maybutcher terms. So feel free to correct me if youneed to.Now, in this case, with the type of spinalcord compression at a C5, C6, would that impact thepatient's ability to speak?A. It could.Q. How so?A. So there is -- first there's a lot ofdocumentation about that in the literature. But themost --the most common reason for that would beinjury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which isthe nerve that affects the vocal cords. So thatnerve can be affected and in fact, often the causeof people being unable to speak.So when somebody is unable to speak, thereis a variety of reasons that that could be. And -but it does not always have to be central, such asan aphasia, an aphasia meaning a condition where youjust cannot either speak or understand or both. Sothe inability to speak may be a mechanical. Youcan't formate the words versus I've lost the abilityto communicate.Q. So if I'm understanding you correctly, inthe C5 and C6 area, there is, like, I guess --doesthat have some sort of control over one's throat orvocal cords?A. So in this case, it's --you've got aherniated disc at C5-6, but he had a spinal cordinjury. So the spinal cord injury is notnecessarily localized to that one spot.Q. So then a herniation to that same area toC5, C6, is it you're testimony that would impactone's ability to speak?A. A spinal cord injury could, yes, and inthis specific case, yes.Q. Okay. But if it's just a herniation andnot necessarily a spinal cord compression, does thataffect one's ability to speak or utilize their vocalcords?A. So is a C5-6 disc herniation, can itaffect the vocal cords; is that you're question?Q. Yes. I'm asking generally.A. All comers in general, so Q. In general.A. -- any person that walks in, yes, itcould.Q. Now, with respect to the injury that theplaintiff sustained in this case, if someone were tosustain something similar to that, would it affecttheir ability to breathe on their own?A. It could.Q. How so?A. So the injury is to the spinal corditself. So the spinal cord is spinal nerves thatexit. And one of them goes to something called thephrenic, P-H-R-E-N-I-C, nerve. And so the phrenicnerve could be injured as a consequence of a spinalcord injury. In addition, the recurrent laryngealnerve that we discussed earlier could be injured,and it can just be product of the initial shock tothe spinal cord.Q. And how common would the ability tobreathe be impacted with an injury such as this? Itthis frequent, not frequent, something else?A. It depends on the nature of the --of theinjury. So the nature of the injury defines whatthe sequale will be. And if you're talking aboutjust C5-6 disc herniations, probably very, veryrare. If you're talking about spinal cord injuries.Where the cord itself has been compromised, then Iwould say that it's a relatively common phenomenadepending on -- well, it's cervical spinal cord.Let me change that. Then it's a fairly -- well, Idon't want to --it's not rare.Q. Okay. So then -- again, I went to lawschool, not medical school.What parts of the body are controlled, oraffected, or impacted -- withdrawn, because that'sgoing to be convoluted.What parts of the body impact -- areimpacted by the C5, C6 area?A. So C5 and C6 would be arms, upper arm, andshoulder. So it was --C5 would go to shoulder,arms, and then it would radiate out to the indexfinger of the hand and the thumb.Q. Okay. And you're saying with the spinalcord compression, that it --if I'm understandingyou correctly --could potentially impact someone'sability to breathe with an injury such as the C5,C6?A. A spinal cord injury, yes.Q. Now, with this spinal cord injury and thedisc herniation that the Plaintiff had at C5 and C6,would that injury affect an individual's bloodpressure?A. It could.Q. How so?A. You can wind up to become hypertensivevery rapidly.Q. And how often and how likely is that withthis type of injury?A. This type of injury, I'd said it's fairlycommon.Q. And with this type of injury with thespinal cord compression as well as the discherniations at the C5 and C6, how would that affectan individual's oxygen saturation, if any?A. Well, it would be contingent upon therespiratory rate and ability to exchange air. Soyou're oxygen saturation would be indirectconsequence of this. It wouldn't affect you'reoxygen concentration directly. It would have to dowith you're ability to breathe in and breathe outand expel gas exchange as you were doing so.Q. Now, at any point prior to today, did youreview the emergency room records at St. Luke's withrespect to Plaintiff's emergency room visit?A. Yes, but I have no recollection of it.Q. Okay. So if I were to tell you that atthe time of his emergency room visit that his vitalswere intact at the time of the visit, would that bepossible with respect with the type of injury thathe sustained?A. At St. Luke's?Q. Yes. So on the date of the incident, atsome point he was sent to St. Luke's, his vitalswere noted as being intact. Is that common withrespect to the type of injury he sustained?A. You need to define the word "intact."Q. If his vitals were deemed stable, doesthat with the type of injury that he sustained, doesthat sound common to you that his vitals would bestable?A. So I don't want to mince words with you,but the word "stable" does not imply normal. So Icould be -Q. Withdrawn. I will withdraw it.At the time of the emergency room visit,his vitals were normal.Is that common, with respect to the typeof injury he sustained?Is that clear enough, or should I rewordit? I'm not trying to be argumentative. I justwant to make sure we're on the same page.A. So his vital signs were normal. That'swhat you're saying to me when he arrived there, andhe arrived by ambulance. I don't know what they didon the ambulance to stabilize him. So yes, it couldbe normal.Q. Okay. Thank you.MR. HEINZE: I think the question was, wasit common, not was it possible. Common.MR. SIVIN: Mr. Miller, you can follow upif you want, but let's finish with Julia.Q. With the type of spinal cord compressionthat was sustained by the plaintiff in this matter,is that the type of injury that would result in somesort of temporary form of paralysis or quadriplegia?A. Could.Q. Now, again, because I went to law school,not medical school, is paralysis or quadriplegia oneof those conditions that could come on and off or isit a permanent condition or something else?A. It depends on how you define the word"paralysis" being "on" and "off." So I would haveto be presented with an examination to determinewhether or not I agreed with the exam. I can'tanswer the question as posed.Q. Okay. So with respect to this instance,where the plaintiff alleged that he had no movementor that it was deemed that there was no movementfrom the neck down, in essence, quadriplegia, isthat the type of condition that can just come on,come off, or is it considered permanent, orsomething else?A. That can occur, and it can be reversibleif you -- if it's caught in time and if you correctthe problem.Q. Now, if the problem is -- how -2withdrawn.How would you correct the problem in orderfor it be reversible in a situation such as theplaintiff?A. So in this case, the way that you do itis, you --is that he had an acute blunt trauma tothe spinal cord causing injury. Following theinjury, they decompressed him, and then he startedto recover.Q. So in this instance, when theydecompressed him, and he started to recover, what isthe likelihood that something such as quadriplegiawould occur again, if it was reversible, since itwas caught in time?A. Another injury.Q. So then my question is: Is quadriplegiaone of those conditions that, if it was caught andcorrected in time --to use you're words --thatcould come again and then disappear again?A. Yes.Q. And what instances have you seen that?A. Chad Stanbro.Q. Other than Chad Stanbro, have you everseen someone that had quadriplegia, where it wentaway and came back, went away and came back?A. Yes.Q. Was that involving a stable decompressedspine, or was it something else in those instances?A. What was the last part that? I'm sorry.I didn't hear that.Q. In the instances that we're talking, asidefrom Chad Stanbro, that you said, yes, you have seenit, what type of injury had you seen it with?A. Spinal cord injuries.Q. So if he had an --after his -- withdrawn.During the course of his surgery, are youaware that an intraoperative neurophysiologicevaluation was done?A. Yes.Q. And just for the record, what is a --Ihave to say it slowly so I don't mispronounce it -an intraoperative neurophysiologic evaluation?A. It's an electro diagnostic test that testsboth the sensory component of nerve, which is calleda somatosensory, S-O-M-A-T-O, sensory response, anda motor evoke response. Meaning that a stimulus issent in, and then you record the result after thestimulus is sent in.So they do that intraoperatively to makesure that they -- well, they establish a baselinepreoperatively, and then they measure itperioperatively to make sure that you, you as thesurgeon, are not causing an injury that is differentthan the injury that the patient sustained. You -did I explain that reasonably?Q. I think so. And it helped -- because youhelped me understand it a little bit during the prepon Friday.Okay. So, now, at the time that Mr.Stanbro underwent the surgery, it is alleged that hehad no sensation or no sensory or motor functionsfrom the neck down.Does that sound fair to you?MR. SIVIN: Objection to the form of thequestion, but you can answer.A. That's what they said. They rated him asASIA 1.Q. Okay. Now, when we spoke tointraoperative neurophysiologic evaluation, whattype of findings would be the baseline for someonethat doesn't have any sensory or motor functionsfrom the neck down?A. Well, that would depend on the person. Soyou can have a evoked -- you can have an evokedresponse and still not be able to function. Soyou're -- those are two different things. You'remeasuring whether or not -- in an evoked response,you're measuring whether or not there is a signalthat you can obtain. It does not define function.It defines --it typically defines A, a surgicalproblem; and B, likelihood of recovery. So it alsoacts a predictive model to determine whether or notsomebody can improve following the surgery.Q. Now --but if someone presents with a lossof sensory or motor functions from the neck down atthe time we're obtaining the baseline, wouldn't somesort of abnormalities be indicated or revealed atthat time?A. Yeah, typically --so, with an evokedresponse -- I'm pretty confident you've seen an EKGand it's an electrical thing that you see a spike.So that's determined in the type of test we'retalking about by the amount of signal that you'resending in. So you can increase the signal todetermine what the response is. It's, kind of,like, a reflex. You send in a stimulus like whenthe doctor takes a hammer and you give a responseback. So it says, yes, I get a response back. Itdoesn't tell you anything about function.Q. And what type of doctor or specialtyperforms that type of procedure, the intraoperativeneurophysiologic evaluation?A. So the test is usually performed by atechnician that is -- because it's all done in thehospital, so the hospitals have technicians that dodifferent things, like when you get an EKG and soforth. So a technician would probably administerthe test, and typically their is a neurologist undera physiologist that is interpreting the studyremotely. Like we're remote right now, the sameidea. They would do it over the computer and cansee the way it forms and likely has direct acommunication with the OR to say, "Oh, there's aproblem."Q. Now, the type of surgery that he Mr. Stanbro underwent, is that one of the surgeriesnowadays can be commonplace or is it not as commonor something else?A. The surgery that he had?Q. Yes.A. I would say it was very common.Q. Now, what type of recovery are we lookingat for a typical patient undergoes this type ofsurgery?A. Probably home the next day with an averageadult, healthy adult.Q. And with this type of surgery would thisinvolve --would this disable a patient fromperforming everyday activities once they undergo it?A. So we're talking strictly all comersreceived for C5, 6, ACDF; correct?Q. Yes, the same surgery. I'm just talkingabout a broad patient. I'm not talking aboutMr. Stanbro.A. It would depend upon the degree of spinalcord involvement. Typically they would regainfunction almost immediately post operatively, butnot necessarily full function. And that wouldrequire rehabilitation and physical therapy, andsometimes you don't fully recover.Q. Now, with respect to Mr. Stanbro'ssurgery, did you review the operative report as wellas any related surgical records at any point,whether at the time of you're IME or in anticipationfor today?A. I reviewed them. It would have been awhile back. It wasn't something that I can tell youwith 100 percent accuracy. It was not somethingthat I reviewed for today.Q. Okay. Now, based upon -- and if you know-- was there anything in the review of his -- of theoperative report or related surgical record that wasremarkable to you, as opposed to --or somethingthat is --yeah, that was remarkable with respect toit? I can rephrase if you don't understand thequestion.A. I think I understand it. No, I thoughtthat the surgical report was very straightforward.It seemed like he had a good surgical result becausealmost immediately postoperatively he was able tomove his arms, which he couldn't do before.Q. Now, I'm almost done. I'm going to referyou to Page 16 of you're report. Let me know whenyou're there.A. Okay.Q. So the third --first paragraph, thirdline down with the sentence starting "prior." Letme know when you're there.A. I'm there.Q. Okay. "Prior to the incident, he wasentered" -- withdrawn.Let me start from the beginning. "OnJune 25th, 2020, Chad Stanbro presented at the ArnotOgden Medical Center Emergency Department after asuspected hanging."Did I read that correctly?A. Correct.Q. The next sentence: "He was an inmate atthe Chemung County Jail, and was found lying on theground with a sheet tied around his head."Did I read that sentence correctly?A. Yes.Q. And, "Prior to the incident, he wasambulatory and able to move all four extremities."And did I read that correctly?A. Yes.Q. So -- and the next sentence: "After beingfound lying on the ground, he was reportedly unableto move the upper or lower extremities, andreportedly had no sensation to the upper or lowerextremities."Did I read that correctly?A. Yes.Q. Now, my question, Dr. Todd, is: If we -4at this point in June 25, 2020, so approximatelyalmost two years after this incident, if there is astable decompressed cervical spine, how would anattempted strangulation or hanging affect his priorinjury?A. Injury to the already damaged spinal cord?Q. If he was already stable and able to movehis four extremities, would something as anattempted hanging affect that if his -- the C spinewas already de --it was stabilized?A. Well --so there's a difference betweenhis C spine and his spinal cord. His C spine is thebony protection, the vertebrae, that surrounds thespinal cord. And so the spinal --the spinalvertebrae, okay, the spinal canal may have beenstabilized, okay, but the internal workings, thespinal cord that lives there, is still susceptibleto injury by -- and Chad Stanbro or anyone.Q. So if he was still susceptible to injury,so to speak, would he be able to move all fourextremities and function -- for lack of a betterterm --up until the point of his suspected hanging?A. Yeah. I think that's perfectly possible,yes.MS. ORTIZ: I think I am done for now.I'll give it to Mark to give him an opportunityto question you. Thank you so much, Dr. Todd,for you're time.THE WITNESS: Thank you.MR. HEINZE: Dr. Todd, are we good to go,or do you need a break?THE WITNESS: No, I'm good to go.EXAMINATIONBY MR. HEINZE:Q. Okay. Dr. Todd, my name is Mark Heinze.I am the attorney for Correction Officers Deal andPalou. I will be jumping around a little bitbecause a lot of this was --or a lot things werecovered, and I'll try not to be --or repeat whathappened already.You attribute the injury here to acuteblunt trauma; correct?A. Yes.Q. And is there anything --leave aside thefacts of this case -- is there anything that couldcause this type of injury other than acute blunttrauma?A. Yes.Q. Can you tell me what other things couldcause an injury of the nature of this one here?A. Spinal cord abscess, meningitis, tumor,subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.There's probably others. As I sit here today, I'mprobably not prepared to give you the differentialdiagnosis, but -Q. I understand.Would you --that grouping in general,would that be, like, disease or conditions that arein the nature of internal medicines of the -- to theinjured person?A. I don't understand the question.Q. Well, is there anything external thatwould cause this kind of injury? Everything youjust --regarding everything you just told us asinternal disease or disease processes, was thereany -- is there anything external, like, the acuteblunt trauma, that would cause this injury, otherthan the disease processes you described?A. Well, only different mechanisms ofinjuries. So motor vehicle accident, selfinflicted, those sorts of things.Q. Right. Well, let me ask you: Would thistype of injury attributable to hanging, would youcharacterize that as acute blunt trauma?A. It could be. Sure.Q. Right. More generally, is that expression-- that expression, "acute blunt trauma," it doesn'thave anything to do with the fault or the cause ofthe trauma; correct?A. No, it doesn't. It tells you nothingabout the injury itself.Q. Right. It just explains the immediatesource of the injury; right?A. It describes what happened. It doesn'tdescribe the source.Q. Right. And it doesn't -- and it doesn'tattribute fault to anybody; right?A. In general?Q. Yeah, in general.A. I -- sure. If it's a motor vehicleaccident, it's -- no. I don't agree with thatstatement.Q. All right. I didn't make a statement.I'm saying, you can suffer this injury due to amotor vehicle accident; you can call it acute blunttrauma, and that would tell you nothing about whowas at fault of the accident; is that correct?A. I don't agree with that statement, no.Q. Okay. So tell me, why do you disagree?A. Well, you're lumping everything together,when that's -- and maybe I just don't understand thequestion -Q. Okay.A. -- and maybe that's the whole problem.But if you have an acute blunt trauma secondary to amotor vehicle accident, well, then the injury issecondary to the car accident and the drivers to thevehicles. It's not secondary to the police whoresponded.Q. I agree with everything you said.What I'm getting at is, it doesn't sayanything one way or the other about who is at faultfor the accident; that is who caused the accidentdue to negligent driving or for some other reason;one way or -MR. SIVIN: Mark, I think we can -- I canstipulate to that. The fact that he had blunttrauma does not implicate Deal as opposed toWeber as opposed to some other defendant.MR. HEINZE: All right. Fair enough.Okay.Q. As you know the facts, Doctor -- let'sstrike that.Let's go the incident as it occurred inthe operatory. As you know the facts, based on yourreview of the record, and the video to the extentthat that helped you, is it your understanding thatMr. Stanbro was belligerent?A. I believe that's what's alleged, yes.Q. Okay. Is that your understanding, is whatI'm asking.A. That's what was alleged, yes.Q. Okay. How about disoriented? He wasdisoriented; right?A. Absolutely.Q. Yeah. And he was partially anesthetized;right?A. That's absolutely correct.Q. Yeah. And that would have made himresistant to pain; correct?A. I don't like the word "resistant" to pain.You can be anaesthetized and still feel pain. Ithink that it would --I think the word that I woulduse, is that it would "lower" his pain threshold.Q. Well, it would raise it; right? In otherwords, it would make him more tolerant to pain thana non-anaesthetized person; right?A. Yes, I think we're mincing a word there.It would lower the amount of --yes, that's fine. Ithink you and I are on the same page.Q. Right. He would be more tolerant thansomebody who wasn't under the influence of thatmedication; right?A. He would be more tolerant than somebodyelse; is that what you asked?Q. Yes.A. Yes.Q. Okay. And just as you know, he would beless cooperative than somebody who was under theinfluence of such anesthesia; correct?A. Yes, I agree with that statement.Q. And less compliant; correct?A. I agree with that statement as well.Q. And less capable of listening to andfollowing instructions; true?A. I would agree with that statement.Q. And more difficult to subdue; right?A. Could be. I don't have an opinion aboutthat.Q. Okay. Take a look at Page 4 of you'rereport. This refers to the MRI that was done atWestchester. Tell me when you're there.A. I'm there.Q. Okay. And tell me if I'm wrong. Thisrefers to the MRI that was taken after he wasreturned from the jail to Westchester and before hissurgery; right?A. Yes.Q. Okay. And at C3 and C4 in your firstbullet point there at the bottom of the page, itrefers to C3 and 4.That refers to vertebrae in the neck area;right? Tell us in laymen's term where the C3 and C4are.A. Let's go backwards if we could. So atyour shoulder level, that would be C7 vertebrae, andthen you can count up. So C6 is above that, justthe way you would think, C5, C4. So C3 probably atthe lower portion of the ear to the midportion ofthe ear, but in the midline. So this is countingup.Q. Okay. And observed in that area was ashallow disc osteophyte; right?O-S-T-E-O-P-H-Y-T-E. Do you see that?A. Yes.Q. Okay. And tell us in laymen's terms whata disc osteophyte is?A. A bone spur.Q. Okay. And that can be attributed to thetrauma that experienced here; right?A. No.Q. That could be attributed to naturalhealing of a prior injury; right?A. That would be possible.Q. I'm not saying you know. I'm saying thatone of the possible -A. (Indiscernible.)I'm sorry. I didn't mean -THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, Lauren.Q. Actually, I think I jumped over you.A. So that would not be the first thing Iwould think about, but, yes, that's possible.Q. Okay. Is the first thing you think aboutnatural processes?A. Yes. Wear and tear.Q. Okay. Natural ageing?A. Yes.Q. Okay. What about the prior hangingincident in 2017? Could it be attributable to that?A. Might.Q. All right. Is it unreasonable to thinkthat it could be attributable to the hanging in17?A. I don't think it's unreasonable, but Iwouldn't testify to that with a reasonable degree ofmedical certainty. I would say that would be verylow on my list.Q. Okay. Well, what's higher on your listthan that?A. The things that we talked about. Thenatural --the -- just natural progression. Youknow, activities. This guy appears to have been inalterations before. This is not new to him. Sothat this would seem to me to be more likely to bethe cause than -- than that.Q. Right. I was just going to ask you itmight be attributable to the fight that dislocatedhis jaw prior to the operatory incident that's theissue in this case; right?A. Possible, but probably not. This appearsmore chronic than that.Q. Okay. In general, how -- were theosteophyte to be attributed to a prior injury asopposed to a natural process, how much time wouldyou normally expect to elapse before it wouldappear, months, years?A. Months, probably. I'm guessing. I -- itreally just depends on level of activity and thenature of the original injury.Q. Understood. Okay.Is there a minimum amount of time youwould expect to see?Strike that.Would there be a minimum about of timebefore you would expect to see it between thetraumatic event and the appearance on the MRI of thedisc osteophyte?A. Yes.Q. What do you think the minimum amount oftime is?A. Well, like you said, months, at least, Iwould think.Q. Two or three months, something like that?A. At least.Q. Okay. So you attribute that as anabnormality, but you don't want to associate thatwith the injury that occurred in the incident here?A. I don't attribute that to the injury thatoccurred here. That is correct.Q. How about the rest of that bullet point?Referring to the right-sided uncovertebralhypertrophic change.A. Those are all chronic changes notattributable to the injury.Q. Understood.Could they have exacerbated the injurythat he suffered? Meaning that he had thesepreexisting chronic conditions that would haveexacerbated the injury that was caused.A. So did this exacerbate his acute blunttrauma, no. The acute blunt trauma could haveexacerbated those, but not the reverse.Q. You're saying that they don't make anydifference here in terms of the injury that existsin the body right now?A. Well, right now, no, I wouldn't say that.That the --I guess I don't understand yourquestion. I think you've got to clarify that forme.Q. Okay. If you don't understand thequestion, which is more than likely when I ask it,just say so.I'm just asking: That first bullet point,does that have any bearing on the impact of theinjury one way or the other? Meaning he had this,he didn't have it. Does it affect the permanentinjury you described in you're report?A. So I don't think that it affects hispermanent injury. I think his permanent injuriesare a result of the blunt trauma to the neck 100percent.The first bullet point is something thatpreexisted it and that was in no way responsible forthe acute blunt trauma; it had no relationship toit. But it could have progressed as a consequenceof the blunt trauma that we're discussing occurredon the 31st.MR. SIVIN: Guys, it's 12:15. You know,if you'd like we can go for a few additionalminutes because we had some technicaldifficulties, but as you know, Dr. Todd hasother obligations and we've been going at thisa few hours. Mark, how much longer do youthink you have?MR. HEINZE: I can finish in five minutes.MR. SIVIN: Okay. Dr. Todd? Okay.THE WITNESS: Yeah.MR. HEINZE: Just quickly, Doctor.Q. Is the same true for Point 2?A. Yes.Q. Point 2? Okay. And how about the point? Bullet Point 3?A. Bullet Point 3 is the acute blunt trauma.Q. Got it. Okay.And where it says, "No stimulant intensitychanges seen in spinal cord," does that speak to youone way or the other about the degree of injury tohis spinal cord?A. Well, it leaves out the part where he hadthe spinal cord contusion, which doesn't appear inmy report, but does appear in the MRI report as anaddendum. So he had a spinal cord contusion thatwas documented on the MRI.Q. Okay. So that's something you should haveput in you're report?A. Yes. Well, my short answer is, I may havereceived that record after I authored the report.That's my best answer to that.Q. Okay. So the precise injury thatyou're -- that is or should be in your report isthat contusion to the spinal cord?A. That was part of it, yes.Q. Okay. What's the other part?A. Well, C5, 6, Bullet Point 3, rather than Q. The disc herniations, C5 and C6?A. Correct.Q. Got it.Just quickly, Judge -- Doctor -- maybe Ididn't understand. I'm going to share the screen,the notes.(Mr. Heinez shared his screen.)Q. Do you see that?A. It says, "Marcus" -- okay. Yeah, I'mthere.Q. Are those the notes that --maybe this wascovered --but are those the notes of Gina Walters?A. Yeah, W-A-L-T-E-R-S. Yes.Q. Right. And you didn't take any notesyourself, so it's just Gina -- Gina's notes and -A. Yes. I looked at that before. That isall her writing. Go to the next page. Whoops. Allher writing. Yeah. There's nothing on there that'smine.Q. Got it.A. Not even a pencil mark.Q. All right, Doctor. He -- Mr. Stanbro sawyou in your Liverpool office?A. Yes.Q. Yeah. And you're in Suite 210, right?A. Yes.Q. All right. And how do you get from theground floor to Suite 210?A. Well, there's two ways; an elevator and astair -- well, actually, I think there's twostaircases in the building.Q. Do you know how Mr. Stanbro got to youroffice?A. Didn't ask.MR. HEINZE: That is it. That is all Ihave. Thank you.THE WITNESS: Thank you.MR. HEINZE: I just have --oh, I'm sorry.Iolanda's raising her hand.But you're not on speaker. Yourmicrophone isn't on.MR. SIVIN: Well -MR. HEINZE: I think you -MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA: Okay. I don'tthink we'll get there yet. Claudine, do youhave, like, a follow-up, any follow-ups?MS. WEIS: Do you have any follow-up?MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA: I do. That'swhy I just wanted to see if you wanted to gofirst. It's up to you. You can go ahead. Ijust had something really quick.MS. WEIS: No. I'm okay. Let's not takeany more of his time.MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA: Really -- no,I know. I had just forgotten to mention thisbefore, and I didn't know if anybody else wasgoing to cover it.FURTHER EXAMINATIONBY MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA:Q. Dr. Todd, did you -- are you aware thatMr. Stanbro had thrown himself out of the dentalchair two times?MR. SIVIN: Object to the form of thequestion. Assumes something not in evidence.MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA: Could he A. I know that's what's alleged. I don'thave knowledge one way or the other.Q. You said you didn't read the transcriptsof the guards; is that correct?A. I said I don't remember. I didn't say Ididn't read them.Q. Okay. Because those were not listed inyour report as materials that you reviewed. I guessif you will accept my statement that two of theguards testified that the plaintiff had thrownhimself out of the dental chair, two times, maybe inan effort to injure himself -- are you familiar withthat at all?A. Well, they drew a conclusion. "In aneffort to injure himself." He was under the affectsof the anesthesia. He was delirious -Q. Well, did they give you -- you recalledthose --I don't know if you want to call them"facts," but two of the guards testified to that.A. I have no recollection of any of thattestimony.Q. Okay. So don't you think it's important,as a neurologist making conclusions about thecausation of a person's injury, that you considerall of the relevant testimony?A. Well, this was blunt force trauma. So itwas 100 percent. So yes, you would consider thattestimony, and then you would have to think aboutthe rest of the testimony. If you want to show itto me, if you would like me to review it, you can.Q. We're at the end of our time. Like Isaid, I don't want to take up your time.I just thought that, if an expert isrendering an opinion, that they would take all ofthe testimony into account before making conclusionsabout the cause of the cervical spine injury.A. I don't know that I necessarily disagreewith that statement. So -Q. Okay. So is it possible that his injurywas caused by him throwing himself out of the chairtwice?A. Is it possible?Q. Yes.A. Sure. He was delirious. So anything ispossible.Q. Do you know that he was delirious?A. Yes. We just went over that whenMr. Heinze questioned me.Q. And he could have been delirious, but youdon't know that he was delirious?A. Well, that's based on education.Q. Would you agree with that, yes or no?A. With a reasonable degree of medicalcertainty, he was delirious.Q. Okay. In your report you have --youmentioned that the -- Mr. Stanbro's second hangingsuicide attempt would not have resulted inquadriplegia had it not been for the incident ofAugust 31st, 2018; is that correct?A. Yes.Q. So -- and I believe you put as a reason,because he did --he recovered rapidly from thefirst suicide attempt; is that why?A. I don't even recall there being sequaleneurologically from --you're speaking of the firstsuicide attempt; you're talking about 2017?Q. Let me just pull it up real quick. Had -5Opinion No. 2, on Page 16, the fourth bullet pointdown: "Had Chad Stanbro not been the victim ofsubject incident of August 31st, 2018, he would nothave developed quadriplegia after the June 2020attempted suicide, as he had a rapid recovery fromthe similar incident prior to August 31st, 2018."A. Correct.Q. So is it certain that his body would havereacted the same way to the second suicide attemptthat it did to the first one, had there been noincident in between?A. It would seem that way, yes.Q. What proof do you have -- well, before Isay that, aren't there different factors that gointo a suicide attempt, different materials,different angles, different factors?What proof do you have that he would havereacted the same exact way to the second one that hedid to the first one?MR. SIVIN: Objection to form. You cananswer.A. I can answer it in the following way: Hemay not have responded in the exact same manner. Isuppose he could have had a severe enough injuryeven absent the blunt trauma that he sustained.That's a possibility, yes, but that he did not haveit the first time, and he did have it the secondtime, and there was an intervening of the bluntforce trauma, that's the reason for that conclusion.Q. Okay. And you say in your reportsomewhere that, by Plaintiff not going to the ERimmediately, he suffered a further injury; is thatcorrect?A. Yes.Q. Okay. So how did you come to thatconclusion?A. Well, he was transported from Westchesterback to Fishkill. He was on a bench. He went onthe bench there without neck protection. He wasthen brought in a Stryker chair inside theinfirmary, and inside of the infirmary, he slid,fell, whatever, out of the chair, and landed on thefloor because he was not protected in the chair withsome form of seat belt, and, again, he didn't haveon any sort of cervical collar.Q. Do you recall one of the guards testifyingthat he was wearing a seat belt?A. I didn't say he was --in the wheelchair,in the Stryker chair?Q. No. I mean in the van.A. No. I'm talking about in the Strykerchair. I don't know whether he was or wasn't. Imean, I would presume that he was in the -Q. What is a Stryker chair?A. Stryker is the manufacturer. So it's likesaying "Chevrolet." So Stryker makes this chairthat's, like, a transport chair. There's varioustypes of Stryker chairs that they have, and theydon't tell you which model it is, but it's atransport chair where you can bring somebody, andyou can transport them from Point A to Point B, andyou can put them in different positions. So there'stypically a reclining feature to it. So you can getthem back. You can put them into something that'scalled (indiscernible), if you needed to. There's anumber of things that a Stryker chair does that'sdifferent than a standard wheelchair that you mighthave if you were --broke your leg and couldn't getaround.Q. Okay. So just by him being put in thischair, that exacerbated his injury?A. It wasn't being put in the chair. It wasfalling out of it.Q. Falling out of it without a restraint?A. Yeah.Q. Is that your testimony?A. Yes, ma'am, it is.Q. Okay. So you say that a relative minorinjury will result in a permanent -- could result -or will result in quadriplegia or death, as Ibelieve Number --do you remember seeing that inyour report?Sorry. Here we are. Bottom of Page 16,"A relative minor injury such as one can sustain inA motor vehicle accident could result in permanentquadriplegia or death."A. With a qualifier of "could," yes, I didwrite that. Yes.Q. Okay. So are you saying that -- could anyof Plaintiff's suicide attempts also contribute tohis having a greater risk?A. So I would say no to the first one. It'spossible, the second one. I mean, the first one, hehad no -- he had no sequela to that. I believe thathappened in 2017. The one that happened in 2020, Iguess that's possible, yes.Q. Okay. And how much is the risk increased,the Plaintiff's risk increased of having permanentquadriplegia or death?A. You mean, like, 1 percent or 99 percent?Q. Yeah. Like, if you can quantify it insome way.A. I don't think I can.Q. You just know that it's increased?A. Yes.Q. Is it double the person, like, a perfectlyhealthy person with no spinal cord injury?A. You can't Q. Is it more towards the lower end; is it 1percent, 2 percent, 10, or is it something, like, 80or 90?A. Well, it really depends on the preexistingcondition. So the best example I can give you isChristopher Reed, the movie actor, who hadabsolutely no history of injury, but was later foundto have had severe spine canal stenosis. He has arelatively minor injury, falls off of a horse, andhe became a quadriplegic. He couldn't even breathebecause he paralyzed his diaphragm as well when hewent down. So it really depends on the preexistingportion of it. And that's what --you know, it'sthat preexisting portion that increases your -- it'san exponential number, not double. It's muchgreater.Q. So this -- like you said, a perfectlyhealthy person could get into a relatively minor caraccident or something like that, and it could resultin permanent quadriplegia or death?A. It would depend on what their preexistingcondition was. So -Q. So, like you said, Christopher Reed had nohistory of that; right?A. Well, he had no known history. That'sdifferent than he didn't have a history. He hadthis to begin with. He just didn't know it. So -Q. So the risk is higher, but you're not ableto quantify it; is that correct?A. I think that's a fair statement.MS. FRANCAVILLA: Okay. I think that'sit. I think I'm done. Thank you so much foryour time. MS. WEIS: I have one quick question. I promise it's one. FURTHER EXAMINATION BY MS. WEIS: Q. Dr. Todd, is there any evidence in the medical record, dental clinic, or the EBT deposition testimony that you reviewed that Plaintiff made any complaints of pain or discomfort prior to leaving the clinic in the custody and control of the Department of Corrections? A. I don't recall. MS. WEIS: Okay. Thank you. I have no other questions. FURTHER EXAMINATION BY MS. D'AMBROSI-FRANCAVILLA: Q. Just one second. I know we went back and forth, but I don't know if you answered the question about whether Plaintiff throwing himself out of the chair could have caused his injury. I apologize if you did, but I just don't have an answer written down.
