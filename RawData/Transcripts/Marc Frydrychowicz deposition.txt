witness?MR. WELLS: Object to form. To the extent that you know. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. Yeah, that you know. A. I was not a 30(b)(6) witness. Q. Okay. All right. Thank you. So you probably -- it's been a little bit ago. I'll just try to refresh your memory real quickly on a few ground rules for this deposition, especially since we're having it over Zoom. So the most important thing to keep in mind is that you are under oath and everything that you say has the same force and effect as if you're sitting in front of a jury testifying under penalty of perjury. Do you understand that? A. Yes. Q. As far as the topics go that you're representing, what you say is binding on the company as a 30(b)(6) witness. Do you understand that? A. Yes. Q. Okay. Since you're under oath, it's important that you don't guess, but I am entitled to your best estimate. So that's just based on your personal knowledge. So if it is within your personal knowledge, I do want your best estimate about it. So just to kind of explain the difference, if I asked how big is your kitchen table, you probably don't know the exacted dimensions, but you have a pretty good idea how big it is. If I asked you how big is my kitchen table, you don't even know if I have a kitchen table, right, so that would be a guess. Do you understand the distinction? A. Yes. Q. Okay. If you don't understand what I'm asking, just ask me to clarify. If you do answer my question, I'll assume that you understood it. Is that fair? A. Yes. Q. And the court reporter is taking everything down. So you're doing a very good job of verbally answering instead of nodding your head or shaking your head because the court reporter can't take those down as part of the record. And also, the most difficult part is going to be pausing before question and answer. So I have to finish my question, you need to finish your answer before I start my next question, and it will be hard to do that. I'm sure we'll fail at some point, but hopefully we can try to make it easier on the court reporter and have a good record. So do you understand that? A. Yes. Q. Okay. You're entitled to breaks. I don't think we'll need one. I'm hoping your section is a bit shorter than the other two. But if you do, just let me know. I only ask that you let me finish the line of questioning before we take a break. Is that fair? A. Yes. Q. And your attorney will likely make objections to put something on the record. But unless he tells you not to answer the question, you still need to answer the question. Do you understand that? A. Yes. Q. Okay. Any reason you can't give your best testimony today? A. No. Q. Is there anyone in the room with you? A. No. Q. Is your phone with you? A. Yes. Q. Is it off? A. No. Q. Can you just turn it off? A. Okay. Q. So can you tell me what your title is? A. Principal and managing director. Q. And how long have you been in that role? A. Two and a half years. Q. What did you do before that? Were you with Milliman? A. Yes. Q. What was your title? A. Director of information technology. Q. How long were you in that role? A. Approximately ten years. Q. And then were you at Milliman before that role? A. Yes. Q. What was your title? A. Manager of information technology. Q. And how long were you in that role? A. Another -- I'm approximating. Q. Yes. A. Another two to three years. This was 2006. Q. When did you join Milliman? A. In 2006. Q. So that was your first role as manager of IT? A. Yes. Q. When you were I guess director of IT, what was your role? Can you explain what you did on a day-to-day basis? A. I oversaw the teams that implemented -- the software development teams and the infrastructure teams that monitored the -- or that -- start over. I oversaw the IT staff that involves development and hosting and administration of our software services. Q. So at that time, it was the IntelliScript software? Is that what you referred to it as, the product? A. Yes. Q. And then now that's evolved into Irix, correct? A. Yes. Q. And did you oversee that transition from IntelliScript to Irix? A. Yes. Q. And you were responsible for basically making that happen, adding in all the medical data as well as the prescription data? A. It fell under my purview, yes. Q. So you are very familiar with Irix then, correct? A. Yes. Q. And how that information is obtained from the data sources? A. Yes. Q. And then as a principal and managing director, what is your role? A. I still oversee the development of our software and administration of our systems. Q. So it's just an elevated position. You have more responsibility? A. Yes. Q. How big is your team? A. Approximately 90 individuals. Q. 9-0? A. Yes. Q. Do you know how big Milliman is, how many employees? A. In excess of 4,600 individuals. Q. So the entire IT department is 90 people, or that's more than the IT department? A. The IT department for the IntelliScript practice is approximately 90 people. Q. And when you say IntelliScript practice, how is that different than Irix? A. Within Milliman, there are separate business units that operate under the Milliman umbrella. IntelliScript is one of those business units. Irix is one of the products that the IntelliScript practice offers to the marketplace. Q. And does IntelliScript, that business unit, encompass all of the business involving insurance clients? MR. WELLS: Object to form. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. Do you want me to rephrase that? A. So -- no. Q. Okay. So to make sure I understood you, so how big is the IntelliScript business unit that you just described? A. We have about 280 individuals in total, employees in total. Q. And they all are involved in insurance products, right, or insurance qualifications. Is that correct? A. All of IntelliScript is involved in insurance-related activities, yes. Q. And that's more than life insurance. Is that also medical insurance, or is it all just life insurance? A. No, not just life insurance. Q. What are the other businesses besides life insurance? A. Health insurance is there. There can be other types or variations of final expense benefits or long-term care insurance that could be -- that could be a line of tools as well. Q. So in all of those businesses, the Irix product is what is used. Is that correct? A. No. Q. So is Irix only used for life insurance? A. Irix can be used for all of those lines of business, but it's not the only product offering available. Q. But involving Mr. Collins, Irix was the only product that was utilized in his case, correct? A. That's my understanding, yes. Q. Are you familiar with the FCRA? A. Yes. Q. How familiar? Like have you read the statute? Do you understand it on a regular basis or --A. I'm not an expert, no. Q. Okay. So do you understand, like, the difference between 1681EB and 1681I, for example? A. No, I do not know the specific statutes that that's referring to. Q. Okay. Understood. I'm going to pull up the interrogatories, which -- I don't think I've used this as an exhibit yet. I hope I haven't 'cause it will make it harder for Susan. So this is -- I'm going to share my screen. Okay. This is the -- it's the Supplemental and Amended Responses to Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories. Do you see that? A. Yes. Q. Have you reviewed this document? A. I have not. Q. Okay. I think you might be able to answer the questions anyway, but let's try that. MR. WELLS: I want to note for the record that Mr. Frydrychowicz was not identified as the designee to respond to questions about Milliman's discovery responses. MS. McCRAW: Okay. So I just have a few interrogatories and then really going to be pointing to the documents. So it isn't so much about this particular answer. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. But the first one is Interrogatory 2. MS. McCRAW: So I guess I should make sure this is marked as Exhibit 13. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. The first one is Interrogatory 2, and it's basically asking you to describe all the documents and/or communications you sent or received concerning plaintiff or plaintiff's medical history background. It points to these documents. Do you see that? Do you know what these documents are or --A. I do not recognize the --Q. The Bates? A. -- the Bates reference. Q. Okay. So basically what I'm going to refer to is -- well, actually, let me go to it. I'm sorry. Scratch that. I'm going to go to Interrogatory 4, identify and describe any and all procedures, policies, rules, or guidelines governing the manner in which defendant compiles information concerning a consumer, which is something it sounds like you know very well, correct? A. Yes. Q. And this includes the process by which defendant matches compiled information to the consumer and how Milliman excludes information related to other consumers with similar names. And the response is pointing to documents 19 and then 42 through 65. So I'm going to pull up 19 so you can see what the document is, and this will be Exhibit 4 that we've already marked. Okay. Can you see this spreadsheet? A. Yes. Q. Are you familiar with what this is? A. Yes. Q. And is this -- how would you describe what this document is or what this spreadsheet is? A. This is the dispute workbook that our FCRA team utilizes in working through a case with an individual. Q. Are you familiar with what the dispute team --FCRA dispute team does on a regular basis? A. At a high level. Q. Have you ever been involved with a FCRA dispute? A. Many years ago. Q. Back in the IT days or --A. Yes, back when we were very small. Q. Okay. So this -- so you know what this spreadsheet is. This is referred to as one - hold on. Sorry. Sorry. I need to find the right document. So this is referred to as one of the procedures, policies, rules, and/or guidelines governing the manner in which Milliman compiles its data. Okay. The other two documents that are referred to here, 42 through 65, are -- I'm going to mark this as Exhibit -- this is 42, which is Exhibit 14. And this is Milliman 42, which is a dispute process flow. Do you recognize this document? A. I have not worked through this document, no. Q. And the other one is going to be marked as Exhibit 15, which is the Milliman FCRA policies, which is Bates 60. Have you seen this document before? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And in what context have you seen this document? A. I reviewed this document in preparation for today's testimony. Q. Okay. So you reviewed this document but not the dispute process flow chart? A. That's correct. I was not under the impression I was expected to talk to the dispute process today. Q. Okay. Doesn't this document, the FCRA policies, contain the dispute process right here on Bates 64? A. The basics, yes. Q. Are you familiar with this process that's -- as it's described in this document? A. Yes. Q. Okay. Do you believe there's any difference between this process in this document and the dispute process flow chart that you're aware of? MR. WELLS: So, Dawn, just so that I'm clear, Joel Strassburg is the one that is going to be able to talk about in detail Milliman's dispute process. Marc is kind of the matching, how does the system work, how does information come into the system. MS. McCRAW: Okay. So Marc can talk to this document but not the entire dispute process? MR. WELLS: Correct. So if you want -- if it's about how disputes work, Milliman's policy about disputes, that would be Joel. Marc is the guy that knows how the technology aspects work. MS. McCRAW: Okay. Got it. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. Are you familiar, Marc, with the training that happens to ensure basically compliance with FCRA, or is that also Joel? A. I would direct you to Joel on that as well. Q. Okay. Got it. Okay. I want to go to the raw data tab, and can you explain to me what you know about match type zero? MR. WELLS: Asked and answered. Go ahead. MS. McCRAW: I'm asking what he understands about it. MR. WELLS: In his personal capacity? MS. McCRAW: He's in IT -- he's been in IT for 18 years. MR. WELLS: No. But I'm asking are you asking for the answer in his personal capacity? MS. McCRAW: I'm asking in his professional experience as an IT manager. He understands how the --BY MS. McCRAW: Q. My understanding is you understand the match type and how these match types work. Is that correct? A. Yes, I understand match types when there's relevant information. Q. And what is the relevant information that you're referring to? A. The match type would point to the type of information that was used for matching and finding information. Q. Okay. What does match type zero mean? A. Match type zero means that we weren't provided information on how the match occurred. Q. Do you have personal knowledge of Optum's match type or their match policies? A. No, I do not. Q. Okay. I'm going to pull up what is Exhibit 16, which does not have a Bates stamp. I'm going to share this. You mentioned a moment ago that you were deposed in the Healy case, correct? A. Yes. Q. Do you recall this declaration that you authored in that matter? A. I'd ask that we review it if you --Q. Sure, sure. So I'm -- specifically this was basically a declaration regarding specific exhibits of Jodi Nuss in support of plaintiff's motion to compel in Healy. Does that ring a bell? A. It's been some time. Q. And I'll get to a very specific question. So it refers to Exhibits A through C as a query, which, as I believe you know, is -- I'm assuming this, correct, this tab, DX Query, for example? A. I am not -- I do not know that that's what that was referring to. Q. Okay. And there's an Exhibit E that you're referencing, and the document itself is under seal, the Exhibit E. But it's a code used to locate additional zip codes for applicants as part of Milliman's reinvestigation process. Is that tied to the Equifax and Lexis searches? MR. WELLS: Object to form. THE WITNESS: I would speculate. I'd have to speculate yes. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. Okay. So that would refer to this search of using Equifax to find other addresses and zip codes of a consumer? A. I believe that's the case, yes. Q. Okay. And so my question is about this Exhibit F, which is the Milliman's match-type matrix. What is a match-type matrix? MR. WELLS: Object to form. THE WITNESS: There are different match types that can be used for finding information, and the match-type matrix could be -- I expect it's referring to a description of what those -- how those match types behave. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. And did you see in the production by Milliman in this matter that a match-type matrix has been produced? MR. WELLS: Object to form. THE WITNESS: Again, it's been a long time since I have looked at this. That was not -- I was not told to prepare based on my past testimony. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. So this was basically your declaration saying all of these things should be sealed, right --MR. WELLS: Object to form. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. -- 'cause they're proprietary? A. Yes, that makes -- that appears to be the case. Q. Okay. So I have not seen any production of a match-type matrix that shows how the matches are being made. Do you have any reason to dispute that? MR. WELLS: Object to form. THE WITNESS: That you have not seen them? BY MS. McCRAW: Q. That I don't believe Milliman has produced any of the ways that the matches are made. A. I'm not familiar with exactly what we have produced or not produced. If you're saying you haven't been provided a copy, I would expect that to be true. Q. Is this -- this match-type matrix, is this an algorithm, is it code, is it just a logical sequence? In what form does this come? A. This specific document that it's referring to, I would really have to look at it to answer that question. Q. Well, I mean, I'm not referring so much to this particular document, but just the general -- if you were going to say here is how -- here is a match-type matrix, here is how Milliman matches data between a consumer and the source data records, what would that look like? Is that code, software code? What is it? A logic? A. Logic itself would be implemented in software code. We do not use the phrase "match-type matrix" here commonly. That's why I'm not exactly sure what this is referring to. Q. Okay. What do you refer to the logic, the matching logic, as? How do you refer to it? MR. WELLS: Form. THE WITNESS: Oftentimes just as matching logic. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. Okay. And what -- is that in a manual, in a guide? What document exists that describes that logic? A. There are -- there is a document that provides high-level basics of the matching logic. However, detailed information is -- it varies -- it varies from implementation to implementation slightly. Q. What is that document called? A. A specific document name? Match-type descriptions. I don't know if that's precisely the name. MS. McCRAW: Okay. Jeff, I'll talk with you after the depo about this particular document. MR. WELLS: And just for the record, the interrogatory responses that you pulled up actually do have a description for the match types that were used in Mr. Collins' case. MS. McCRAW: Very, very general ones, yes. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. Okay. So I'd like to look at -- are you familiar with the Optum agreements, license agreements? A. Not -- not thoroughly, no. Q. Okay. Your name is listed as of yesterday the person who understands relationship with any vendors, third parties used to source and compile information. A. The technical relationship, yes. But I believe you previously talked with Angela Bolduc. Q. Uh-huh. A. She could speak to the business and legal relationship. Q. Okay. So can you explain to me, when you say the technical relationship, what does that mean? Can you expand on that a little further? A. I'm referring to the actual technical implementation of how we communicate with our data partners, receive information from them. Q. Okay. And is this like in a system requirements document where you're basically saying this is what you need to provide us, this is what we'll provide you? Is that what you mean in terms of data? A. Yes. Q. And the requirement that you need to provide the data sources, is that the demographics? A. Yes. Q. Is there anything beyond the demographics that you need to provide the data sources? A. In relation to the matching --Q. Yes. A. -- logic, no. Q. Okay. And I think Ms. Bolduc said that the minimum requirement was -- let me make sure I got it here --first name, last name, date of birth, and gender. Is that correct? A. Generally, yes. Q. So if that is all that's provided, you can match with data sources based on that information? A. No. Q. What do you mean by no? A. There can be -- there are other optional elements that can be included as well. Q. Such as? A. Social security number and zip code. Q. Right. But in minimum requirements -- what is the minimum requirement in order for matching to occur? A. To the extent I -- so some of our data partners I know more about our matching algorithm than others, and that's where the match types come up. They're the ones that I'm more familiar with, that I have some visibility into. I know the match types. For those, to actually return a match, the four elements you listed are the name, date of birth, and gender -- first name, last name, date of birth, gender would be insufficient to find information. Q. You said insufficient or sufficient? A. Insufficient. Q. Insufficient. Okay. Do you know -- so you don't know what matching actually occurred in Mr. Collins' case, correct? A. With the disputed Optum records, no, I do not. Q. Right. Okay. I'm going to pull up Exhibit 13. Okay. I just want to go to Interrogatory 8. This describes in the response -- this is about just --MR. WELLS: Hang on. MS. McCRAW: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There you go. Okay. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. Interrogatory 8 is really asking about following reasonable procedures. There is a statement here about monitoring and analyzing hit rates. What is a hit rate? A. When we find information on an individual, we call that a hit. And so a hit rate would be the frequency that we find information on people. Q. And when you say find information on people, that means where there was a successful match made with the demographic information that you provided to the insurance company, correct? MR. WELLS: Object to form. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. Or I guess I should say to the data source. A. Not quite, no. Q. What does that mean then? A. It's whether there were successful matches or not, the proportion of requests in our system that result in finding information of some form. Q. And does this mean any information at all for a consumer? A. Of the given data type, yes. Q. So if you want to find medical records, then it's either a yes, I found something, or I found nothing. A hit means I found something. Is that what you mean? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And how is this improving Milliman's process? A. This will -- looking at trends of hit rates will -- can be used to identify anomalies in the data that's returning to our system. Q. What would an anomaly be? A. An unexpected change in hit rate. Q. Okay. So this is a trending kind of measurement that you're looking over time? A. That would be what this is referring to, yes. Q. And then this data enhancement process which allows Milliman to obtain additional demographic data, what is that referring to? MR. WELLS: Object to form. THE WITNESS: That is referring to a process by which we are able to look up additional information on an individual to utilize in finding the medical records. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. Is this additional demographic data zip codes that we looked at earlier from Equifax and Lexis? A. Yes, that includes the zip codes that we looked at earlier. Q. Is it anything else? Is it any other demographic data, or is it basically zip codes? A. Social security number could potentially be supplemented as well. Q. What do you use to find someone's social security number when you're not given one? A. The rest of the demographic information. Q. And that would be through Equifax? A. Yes. Q. Okay. But you don't know -- that didn't happen in Mr. Collins' case, correct? A. Did not, correct. Q. I'm trying to understand this one. Interrogatory  is asking about the Milliman report concerning prescription records, treatment records, physician records, and about the steps that were taken to make sure the information actually belonged to Mr. Collins. And in the response, it says that most of the medical and prescription information contained in Mr. Collins' consumer report was located using IntelliScript's matching Logic. And it talks about an exact match and Mr. Collins' social security number and date of birth. What does that mean, the matching logic was an exact match? A. It means the portion of our matching algorithm that was able to find the -- result in finding information on Mr. Collins was exactly matching on social security number and date of birth. Q. So not the other demographic factors, but it just zoomed in and matched on social security number and date of birth? A. Yes. Q. So it didn't use his name? A. Correct. Q. And it didn't use his zip code? A. Correct. Q. And then it says that seven items of prescription information were identified just using date of birth and his last name. So those were the only two criteria used for prescription information? A. You're not completing the sentence. Q. Oh, oh, sorry. And the first three letters of his first name, first three digits of zip code, and gender. Thank you. Okay. So why is that only seven items were identified using that? The other information was just -- this is, I guess, referring to the logic that you don't know. Is that what that means? A. The last sentence is referring to the logic we don't know, yes. Q. Okay. Which we know was Optum. And then there were seven items of prescription that you do know the logic, and this was the logic code that was used or --A. Yes. Q. Okay. Got it. Okay. I understand. I do have a question on this last -- do you know why -- this is the third-party vendors, and I know by third-party vendors basically we mean data source companies. Do you know why only Optum and Waystar were listed? I mean, there are more, correct? MR. WELLS: Object to form. THE WITNESS: Yes. BY MS. McCRAW: Q. Okay. Yes, there are more than these two? A. Yes, there are more. Q. Okay. In Mr. Collins' case specifically. A. Can you pull up the raw --Q. Yeah. So do I pull up the DX or the RX raw data? A. Just what's right there, I can see that yes, the answer is there were more in this case. Q. Okay. So is this a complete list of all the sources of data for Mr. Collins' report? MR. WELLS: Object to form. THE WITNESS: Looking at this screen, plus you'd need to look at the RX raw data to answer.
