I'll be taking your deposition today. Just as we start what -- what is your business address? A. My business address is 906 Gold Ridge Crossing, Canton, Georgia 30114. Q. And -- and where are you currently today? A. I'm at a Fairfield Inn in Austin Texas. Q. Okay. Are -- You're in your hotel room right now? A. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Q. Well, I -- I appreciate you being here while you're also in Texas. Is there anyone in the room with you today? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. I have pre-marked a number of exhibits as we've gone through this process. I don't know if you received a copy of them in advance of today. Do you -- Did you receive any deposition exhibits? A. I did. Yes, sir. Q. As we go through the deposition I'm gonna refer to them. I can put them up on the screen, but are you able to access them as well? Sometimes it's easier if you can pull them up, but I can do whatever's best for you. A. Yes. I should have access to them. Yes, most definitely. Q. Okay. Wonderful. Are you familiar with providing deposition testimony? A. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. How many times have you been deposed? A. I would say maybe eight or nine. Q. Okay. So just the basic ground rules; and I'm sure you're aware, everything is being transcribed and recorded so we can't speak over each other. Speak clearly. I'll often chew on my own tongue and mispronounce things. So if you don't understand what I say, let me know. And -- and certainly if you need me to repeat anything, just let me know. And if you need a break or anything at any time, just let me know and we'll accommodate you. Okay? A. Sounds good. Thank you. Q. I just kinda want to talk about you for a little bit. Where are you currently employed? A. Right now I am in Austin Texas and I am writing up estimates for a contractor here Q. Okay. A. -- for the next week or so. Q. Okay. Who do you work for; I mean A. Oh, for myself in that sense. Yes. With H-Squared Consulting Group. Q. Okay. So H-Squared Consulting Group is your company. A. That's correct. Yes. Q. How big is the company? How many employees are there? A. Me, myself, and I. It's just myself. Q. Okay. And I know you -- I guess what does H-Squared Consulting do? A. Provide estimate services to contractors, lawyers, homeowners. I also do independent adjusting for carriers. I do alternative dispute resolution for insurance carriers, appraisals, umpire work and that such. Q. Okay. So I -- and just so I -- You'll sometimes work for contractors, insurance companies, homeowners; is that correct? A. This is correct. Yes, sir. Q. Do you work for any public adjusting firms or independent adjusting firms? A. No, sir. No. Q. Okay. Before you went out on your own and -- and started H-Squared; if I refer to it as H-Squared is -- is that okay? A. Absolutely. Yeah. That's fine. Q. Okay. Where were you employed before that? A. With an independent firm -- with a couple independent firms; on was by the name of Worley Catastrophe Services. They're now known as Alacrity. And then there's another firm called QA Claims, Pilot Claims. There's a number of independent firms that I'll contract out with. Q. Were you -- I mean, for those past employers were you working or contracted to work as some kind of adjuster? A. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. Do you hold any professional licenses? A. Yes. I have adjuster licenses. Q. Which -- Do you hold any licenses in Florida? A. I have an adjuster's license in Florida. Yes, sir. Q. Do you know which license it is? A. It is -- I believe it's the All-Lines, but let me check here real quick for you Q. Sure. A. -- I can tell you real quick. (Deponent viewing computer). Non-Residential Adjuster All-Lines. Q. Okay. So where is your home state, I guess, if you're a non-resident in Florida? A. Georgia. Q. Okay. Are you a licensed All-Lines adjuster in Georgia? A. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. And in the other states are you licensed as an All-Lines adjuster or whatever the equivalent is in those states? A. That's correct. Yes, sir; the states that require you to have a license. There are many states that don't, obviously. Q. Okay. Has your license ever been suspended or revoked in Florida? A. No, sir. Q. What about any other state? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. So for your Florida non-resident All-Lines adjuster license, does it have a qualifying active appointment currently? A. Yes. Q. And what -- were is that appointment -- or who is that appointment with? A. Let's see here. (Deponent viewing computer). I think -- Well, actually it's just an individual license, it says just appointed to me, that's it. Q. You're self-appointed in Florida? A. Yes. Yes. Q. Has that always been the case for your non-resident All-Lines adjuster license? A. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. And are you appointed in Florida as an independent adjuster, or a public adjuster, or any other difficult type of license? A. Just the license that I have as far as independent adjuster. I'm basically a non-resident license, yes, sir. Q. Does H-Squared hold any agency license in Florida; adjusting firm, public adjuster firm? A. No, sir. Q. What about in Georgia? A. Adjusting firm? No, sir, ut-um. Q. And then other then your All-Lines adjuster license, do you have any other professional license in Florida? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. I would like the refer you to what I have pre-marked as Exhibit 54. If you're able to pull it up yourself let me know, otherwise I will put it on the screen. (Exhibit 54, Defendant, Church Mutual Insurance Company's Notice of Taking the Videotaped Deposition Duces Tecum of David Cianchetti, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. I have it now. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. Okay. And this is the Notice of taking your deposition. Have you seen this before today? A. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. Did you have a chance to review it before your deposition? A. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. Starting on Page 2 there were four categories of documents that I requested you either bring with you today or you may have previously produced them and I would like to discuss those. Did you have a chance to review these four categories of documents? A. Yes, sir. Q. Category A ask for any communications between yourself and any other individual or entity in connection with this litigation, St. Michaels loss that occurred on October 10th, 2018, its insurance claim with Church Mutual or related to the work you performed related to St. Michaels. Have you brought any of those communications with you or have you previously produced them to Ms. Dodge or Mr. Hamilton? A. Yes. I previously produced them to them. Q. Okay. I'd like to refer you to Exhibit 55. (Exhibit No. 55, David Cianchetti Gmail Communications, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. This is 49 pages of communications involving you. I would just like you -- you know, scroll through it, and I would like to know if you recognize these e-mails and if this is the extent of your, you know, written communications in this case. And please take your time. A. Sure. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes, that's correct. Q. Okay. And -- and do these e-mails appear to be -- these copies appear to be accurate, you know, representations of your communications in this case? A. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. Are there any, you know, internal communications in H-Squared that haven't been produced or -- or any other written communications with any other person or entity that aren't in this e -- exhibit? A. No, sir. Not that I'm aware of. No, sir. Q. Okay. The next thing I requested in Exhibit 4 under Category B is any reports or estimate prepared on behalf of plaintiff related to the litigation, its loss that occurred on October 10th, 2018, its insurance claim with Church Mutual, and the document and materials you relied on in preparing them. Have you prepared any reports or estimates in this case? A. I have. Yes. And I submitted that to Mr. Clark and Ms. Dodge. Q. Did you -- how many estimates did you prepare? A. I believe the first initial estimate I wrote was just for Windham; Ms. Windham, and the church. I think then there's a request for one to reflect depreciation in the estimate. And then I believe the third one was to revise the estimate based on an updated engineering report. Q. Okay. I'd like to refer you to three exhibits, but we'll start with Exhibit 23; if you can pull that one up. (Exhibit No. 23, H-Squared November 6, 2019, Estimate, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. I have it. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. Okay. Is this the -- I mean, it says date DAVID CIANCHETTI ST. MICHAELS ANGLICAN CATHOLIC vs CHURCH MUTUAL Page 19 of 159 April 07, 2021 entered November 6th, 2019. On the secretary page it say on the bottom 12-2-2019. Is this the first estimate you prepared for Ms. Windham? A. Yes, I believe so. Yes. Q. Okay. And if I look on Page 32 of the PDF, it just indicates that the item total is three thousand and fifth -- three -- $315,000 -- $315,927.13. That's correct? A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes. That's correct. And that adds up all the coverages. Q. Okay. The I -- the item total is the replacement cost value; is that -- is that fair to say? A. Yes, sir. That's correct. Q. Okay. I'd like to refer you now to Exhibit 29. (Exhibit No. 29, H-Squared November 5, 0, Estimate, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. I have it. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. And on Page 2 at the bottom it says 11/5/2020. Would this be the second estimate you prepared in this case? A. (Deponent viewing computer). Let's see here. Let me go down to where the total is. ret I believe this is a copy of the original estimate is what it is. Q. So if you go to Page 32 -4 A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes. Q. -- of the PDF there's an ACV total and an item total. And it has a ACV total of $282,538.05. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Right. Yeah. This would be the second estimate. You are correct. I'm sorry, I did not see that page. I was looking at the line item total on 32. Q. No. I -- I was gonna getcha there too. Substitutively these two estimates appear to be same; the first and the second estimate, except that the second estimate has an actual cash value determination, correct? A. (Deponent viewing computer). That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. And -- And -- there's a number of photographs attached to each estimate. They also appear to be the same, correct? A. (Deponent viewing computer). That's correct. Yeah. Those -- those were not changed. Q. Okay. The final thing I would like you to look at is what I pre-marked as Exhibit 56. A. Fifty-six. (Exhibit No. 56, H-Squared March 20, 2021, Estimate, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. I have that one up now. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. This one indicates the date entered on 3-30-2021. And if you go to Page 32 it'll give you a new RCV and ACV total. Is this the third estimate? A. (Deponent viewing computer). This is correct. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. There were no additional photographs that were taken for this one? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Was any additional inspection performed to prepare this estimate? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. As -- as far as the estimates you prepared, do these three compromise all of them or is there any other ones we haven't seen? A. These three, I believe, compromise them all. Yes. MR. HAMILTON: You mean comprise. Not compromise. Comprise. THE DEPONENT: Oh, comprise. I'm sorry. Compromise. MR. HAMILTON: Alex said compromise. He meant comprise as well. MR. WHITLOCK: Yeah. And I promise you I'm not clever enough to use the wrong word to try to trick you, I just don't know -7 THE DEPONENT: That's all right. Obviously you know I'm -- I'm in the same boat, so... BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. So these are the three estimates you prepared. There's no other estimates, correct? A. This is correct. Yes. Q. And -- and who prepared these? A. I did. Q. Okay. And was there any kind of review process or a peer review process done when you prepared these? A. The original inspection was based -- my original estimate was based on my inspection of the property. The second estimate was basically revising it based on depreciation values. And then the third one was based on an engineer's report. Q. Okay. But there was no -- I guess I was asking, there was no independent review of your estimates by a peer reviewer before they were finalized and produced, correct? A. You mean by someone else -- reviewed by someone else? Q. Yes. A. No. Q. Okay. We can go back to Exhibit 54. And for number C I requested your project file just in connection with this litigation, plaintiff's loss that occurred on October 10th, 2018, for its insurance claim with Church Mutual. And I just would like to know what documents where in your project file, if any? A. So it was basically my photos and my estimate is pretty much my project file. Q. Did you receive any other estimates? A. There -- there were other documentation that was provided to me. Like I got a copy of the insurance adjuster's estimate, some photos, obviously, of some contents that were damaged, I believe a copy of the policy. Let's see here. (Deponent viewing computer). Like an audit report from an adjuster reviewing, I think a previous contractor's estimate. And I want to say at one point I did see an engineer's report at one point from the insurance carriers, but for some reason I don't have a copy of that. Q. Okay. So let's kinda break that down. I believe you said you received an adjuster's estimate. A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. Do you know who the adjuster was? A. (Deponent viewing computer). Let's see here. I could tell ya. It looks like the claim rep on it was Glenn Gledhill. Q. Do you have that -- that estimate with you? A. I do. Yes, sir. Q. Could I refer you to Exhibit 20? A. Exhibit 20. (Exhibit No. 20, October 24, 2019, Payment Letter, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). I have it. Do you hear me? MR. WHITLOCK: Yes. THE DEPONENT: Oh, okay. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. If you want to go to page -- can you go to Page 3 of the PDF document? A. (Deponent viewing computer). I am there. Yes, sir. Q. So Page 3 through 26 are -- are an estimate prepared by Glenn Gledhill. I just want to confirm if this is the estimate you were referring to. A. Let's see. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes, sir. That appears to be the same one. Q. Did you receive any other estimate from Glenn Gledhill? A. No, sir. Q. And -- and what was your understanding of Glenn's role in -- in this case? A. My understanding was he was the adjuster assigned to the claim. Q. Okay. By an insurance company? A. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. And then I -- you indicated you received a copy of the insurance policy. A. Yes. I believe just -- let's see. (Deponent viewing computer). Yeah. It was just a photo image of the actual declaration page and that was it. Q. Okay. And then you indicated you received an audit summary, could -- could you elaborate on that for me? A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes. It -- it appears to be -- it -- it's just labeled like a St. Michaels Audit Report. And it looks like -- it looks like just an actually -- it looks like and Excel spreadsheet was completed based on a contractor's estimate. And it itemizes through what line items and what they should remove and basically itemizing throughout the whole estimate what they think should not be included in the estimate. Q. Could -- could I (inaudible) to Number 15? THE COURT REPORTER: I'm sorry, I did not get that, Mr. Whitlock. MR. WHITLOCK: I asked him to refer to Exhibit Number 15. THE COURT REPORTER: Thank you, sir. MR. WHITLOCK: Yes, ma'am. (Exhibit No. 15, Audit Summary, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). That is correct. That's the -- that's the same one. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. And do you know who prepared this or -- or what estimate it was of? A. I do not. Q. Okay. And then you indicated you had some engineering reports, but you don't have those with you. A. Correct. Yeah. I saw the original report at some point. And I don't know how I saw it with regards to the church from the carriers engineer, but I checked all -- everywhere I have and I -- I don't have any record of showing it. But I do remember just specific parts of the -the report when I was writing up my estimate. Q. Do you recall what the name of the engineer or the company involved in it? A. The only reason I know is HAAG, but I believe that's because I saw it in one of the exhibits. Q. Okay. Well, then let's look at Exhibit Number 19 then. (Exhibit No. 19, HAAG Engineering Report, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. And -- and you can scroll through it. I mean, it's long, but I just wanted to know if you recognized this document. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes, I do. Q. Okay. How do you recognize it? A. At some point I -- I saw it or I've seen a copy of it, or someone has provided me with it to -- to look at because I remember the mentioning of the trusses within the sanctuary area was mentioned on the report. Q. Did -- did you have it -- It doesn't sound like you remember a specific date. But do you know if you saw it before or after you prepared your first estimate? A. It -- it would have to be before I prepared my first estimate because that's how I wrote up my estimate based on what the engineering planning were with regard to the trusses in the sanctuary area. Q. Okay. So you -- you used this to account for some trusses in your first estimate, correct? A. That is correct. Yes, sir. Q. Have you seen any other engineering reports? A. Yes. I saw a report just recently that was completed showing that they did a thorough investigation, I believe of the whole attic and recommended replacement of all the trusses. Q. I believe that would be what I have pre-marked as Exhibit Number -- Well, please look at Exhibit Number 51 and let me know if you recognize that document. (Exhibit No. 51, Sonny Gulati, P.E., Supplemental Report, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). That is correct. That's it. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. Any other engineering reports? A. No, sir. That's it. Q. Okay. Is there anything else that would be part of your project file; and now I'm afraid to say comprise because I butchered it earlier, but is there anything else that would be part of your project file or that you relied on in -- in -- in performing your work for St. Michaels or preparing your estimates that we haven't talked about or that you didn't bring with you today? A. I'm trying to think. The -- the contents items were provided by Mr. Windham. That's the only other thing that I can think of that we did not mention. So -- but other than that we have completed that's his all that I have to my knowledge. Q. As far as the contents items, could I refer you to Exhibit 55. And then PDF Page Number 8. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes. I have that. Yes. Correct. Q. Okay. And -- and these are e-mails between Ms. Windham and yourself. It looks like there's a number of photos attached between Pages 8 and 11. Do you recognize those photos? A. (Deponent viewing computer). I do. Yes, sir. Q. And what are those? A. Those are the photos of the documents of the books and the pews and that such that were provided to me by Ms. Windham showing they were damaged during the storm. Q. Are those the contents items you were referring just now that we just discussed? A. Yes, sir. That's correct. Q. Okay. Does that now cover everything that would be in your project file? A. Yes. To my knowledge, yes. Q. Okay. Were there any field notes? A. The only field notes I really take is I kinda use Xactimate codes and I may write those down on a piece of paper. But then once I transport those into my estimate, it's the same codes that are in my estimate. And the basically I just -- those little sheets are just chicken scratch and I don't usually keep those. Q. And -- and A. Go ahead. Q. I -- I believe there's diagrams attached to your re -- estimates, but beyond that no other diagrams or any other kind of drawings? A. No, sir. I take my laptop in the facility when I'm there and I sketch it and diagram it all on -- on spot. Q. Okay. Any kind of Xactimate or XactAnalysis notes that weren't produced or that you created? A. No, sir. Everything was produced in that estimate. Q. Okay. The last category in Exhibit 54 is any and all documents that you relied upon to prepare for this deposition. And I just want to know what those were, if any. A. The documents I relied upon are the ones that we already covered. For instance, my site inspection obviously, but the engineer reports, the contents listing from Ms. Windham, and then also the other estimate and stuff from the carrier is what I utilized. Q. And -- and who helped put these document together for you or did you collect them and provide them to counsel? A. I collected them. The documents that I had is what I received from Ms. Windham and -- and that's what I keep in the folder, and that's what I provided to counsel. Q. Okay. I would like to talk briefly about some of your other testimony. You can open Exhibit 57, if you have it. (Exhibit No. 57, David Cianchetti Testimony List, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. I have it. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. Do you recognize this document? A. I do. Yes. Q. Okay. What -- what is this? A. (Deponent viewing computer). It's just another file that was referred to me to write up an estimate on. And it's probably a deposition -- deposition list -- actually it's the deposition list that I've done in the past year, year and a half is what it is. Q. So when we talked about had you previously been deposed, I think you said maybe eight times, this has six. A. Yeah. I don't remember them all so I don't keep track of them. It's not like anything that I'm boasting on by no means. So this is just from my recollection of what I've had in the last few years. Q. Okay. So you've been deposed less then maybe ten times; is that fair? A. That's probably fair. Yes, sir. Q. Have you ever testified in trial? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. From the times that you've been deposed, were you testifying as an expert? A. In some cases. Yes. Q. Do you know how many times you testified as an expert? A. I would say probably 80 percent of them. Q. Okay. And, I guess, what were you -- what -what were you an expert -- what opinions were you offering relating to, was it insurance-claim-related stuff or -- or values of claims? A. Yeah. Insurance related stuff, in regards to writing estimates is what my specialty is in Xactimate. Q. How many of those or what percentage have been for the plaintiff's side? MR. HAMILTON: I'm gonna object to the from of the question, Alex. I -- I think it's a little ambiguous when you say "how many of those". MR. WHITLOCK: All right. MR. HAMILTON: I don't know if you're talking about depositions or estimates he's ever done, that's all. MR. WHITLOCK: That's -- that's fair. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. How -- how many times have -- how many times have you been deposed as an expert witness have you been a witness for the plaintiff's side of the case? A. I would so probably 90 percent of the time. Q. Okay. And I'll follow up to close the point. How many -- when you prepare estimates that have been used in litigation, what percentage of those have been for the plaintiff's side and what percentage of those have been for the defense side? A. Just in regards to a litigation standpoint? Q. Yes. A. I would say probably 80 percent would be for the plaintiff side, 20 percent for the defendant's side. Q. And I'm assuming on the defense side those are insurance companies? A. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. In the cases that you testified as an expert was that related -- were any of those related to hurricane damage? A. Yes. The majority of them are. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. Have you ever testified for an insurance company or the defense in a hurricane-related claim? A. Okay. Can you repeat the question one more time? I'm sorry. Q. Yeah. When -- Have you ever testified as an expert witness for a defendant or an insurance company in a hurricane-related insurance claim that had went to litigation? A. That had gone to actual litigation, like to court -4 Q. Yeah. A. -- or just... No. I've never been to court to testify. Q. Or in deposition, I guess, as far as -A. Yes, I have. Q. How many times? A. I would say almost all of the depositions I've had have been with regards to for the plaintiff or the defendant side based on the carrier or the plaintiff side. Q. My -- my question wasn't clear, so I -- I apologize. It sounds like you primarily testified for the plaintiff as an expert witness at deposition, correct? A. That's correct. Yes. Q. Have you ever testified for the defense in a deposition as an expert witness? A. Yes. Q. Okay. Referring to those specifically when you testified for the defense at a deposition, were -- was that related to a hurricane-related claim or something else? A. They would be -- yes, they would probably be the majority of them -- I would have to say all of them are probably hurricane-related. Yes, sir. Q. Do you know how many times you've testified for the defense at deposition in a hurricane-related claim? A. Maybe three; three or four. Q. Okay. Do you know if you have those deposition transcriptions or -- or reports? A. No, sir. It -- basically what you have listed right there are the only ones that I could really remember. So I have a couple more coming up in the next couple months as well. Q. That's fair. In any cases that you testified as an expert witness at deposition, or trial, or in any capacity have the been for either Mr. Hamilton or Mrs. Dodge's law firm? A. Have they ever -- re -- repeat that one more time. Q. Yeah. Have Mr. Hamilton or Ms. Dodge's firm ever retain you to testify as an expert witness besides this case? A. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. How many times? I don't want to know specifics, just the number of times. A. Just guessing maybe six or seven. Q. Okay. So I kinda want to move into your actual involvement in this case. And we kinda touched on it earlier. My understanding is you prepared your first estimate for Ms. Windham; is that accurate? A. That's correct. Ms. Windham's the one that actually called me and asked me if I could provide an estimate for her on this -- on this particular matter. Q. And -- and she asked you to provide an estimate for St. Michaels, correct, not her personally? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. Do you know when that occurred or when that was? A. I don't know the exact date. It could be in those e-mails. I could look at it if you need the exact date. Q. I was gonna say, how about you refer to PDF Page 20 in Exhibit 55. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes. That would probably be correct. Q. And that e-mail between Ms. Windham and yourself is dated November 4th, 2019? A. (Deponent viewing computer). They is correct. Yes, sir. Q. So is it fair to say you became involved around November 4th, 2019? A. Yes, sir. With regards to this case. Yes. Q. Had you worked with Caroline Windham or David Windham before? A. I have. Yes, sir. Q. Just briefly what -- what did you do for them? A. I've written up other estimates for them. I think Ms. Windham had heard of my services through a friend -- a mutual friend of hers and she contacted me. And I've written up an estimate for her on, I believe, like her niece's house, her own house, her business, and then, of course, this church. And then I think she's referred me to a few other people as well along the line. Q. All right. Was there any compensation or referal fee from Ms. Windham or David Windham for getting you involved in the St. Michaels case? A. Referal fee? Q. Correct. I -- I understand that you were paid for your services for working for St. Michaels. I just want to know if you do any kind of referal fee or discount to anyone else who brings you business? A. No, sir. If -- if she brings me multiple projects or something like that, I may -- I may discount it on -- on a few estimates. Or if it's just a small estimate sometimes I'll be like, you know, it's not a big deal, I'll just do it for you since you've given me other work. So it's just on a case-by-case situation. There's nothing in stone on those. Q. Yeah. Did -- did you do anything like that related to the St. Michaels claim or the work you performed for St. Michaels? A. I want to say yes. I'm -- usually like I'll charge like one and a half percent. And then I believe this one was only charged a one percent, so... Q. So -- so the discount you applied was to -- was to your final bill to St. Michaels basically. A. Yes, sir. That's correct. Q. What -- what did Ms. Windham, you know -- I guess she brought you in. What -- what were you asked to do for St. Michaels? A. Basically she just asked me to provide an estimate for the damages to the church from the hurricane. And basically at that point I make arrangements to meet at the church and estimate the damages. Q. So just to break that down. It -- It was your understanding you're, I guess, investigating hurricane-related damage. A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. And was this Hurricane Michael? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. Did you have any knowledge or were you aware that St. Michaels had a pending insurance claim? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Did you become aware that there was a pending insurance claim? A. Not until just now. No, sir. Q. So I guess we kind of touched on it. What what did you do to prepare an estimate? I mean, what -- what goes into that? A. Setting up an inspection date, just an appointment. I go out and meet at the property. Basically I'll do a quick walk-around and then I basically start from the roof then walk around the elevation, look at the interior. I'll bring my laptop in. I will sketch the entire property of the affected areas. I'll take photos and document the damages. And then I basically take that back to my room, my hotel; wherever I might be staying, and proceed to write up the estimate based on what I found. Q. Okay. And, I guess, what is your estimate -- and we'll -- we'll talk more in detail later.I'm just kinda briefly -- what -- what -- the estimate you provided Ms. Windham, what -- what was it telling her, I guess? A. Basically the estimate is just to provide an estimate for the damages I found at the property during my inspection and based on what I -- I read in the engineer's report. Q. Okay. So, I guess, the estimates was to provide an estimate of cost to restore the property to it's pre-loss condition. A. That's correct. Q. Okay. So, I guess, simply stated, you were just helping St. Michaels kinda determine the value of the lost or damaged property. A. This is correct. Yes, sir. Q. That would potentially be paid by the insurance company. A. Yes. It to provide an Xactimate estimate to the insurance carrier. A lot of carriers a lot of times are -- a lot of times require to have an Xactimate estimate; since that's the same platform that they -- they tend to work on. And that's the service I provide; is provide them with that estimate. Q. Okay. Does H-Squared perform any construction services itself? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Are you a licensed, you know, building contractor or general contractor? A. No, sir. Q. Did you coordinate with any other contractors in this case or in preparing your estimates? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Were you working with any lice -- other licensed adjusters for this case. A. No, sir. Q. Were you working for any other licensed adjuster in this case? A. No, sir. Q. Were you working for any adjusting firm; independent or public adjusting firm? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. And I -- I believe, and we touched on it briefly, but if you look at the e-mails, Page 3. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. Q. This is a November 19th, 2019, e-mail, correct, to Ms. Windham? A. (Deponent viewing computer). This is correct. Yes. Q. Is that from you? A. That is the correct. Yes. Q. And is this the invoice you charged for that -4 for your initial inspection in creating your first estimate for St. Michaels? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. Did Ms. Windham pay you directly for this? A. She did. Yes. Q. Okay. Now, my understanding is after this first estimate you were later retained as an expert witness to assist in this litigation, correct? A. Yes. By -- You're referring in regards to the deposition I'm taking now? Q. Sure. I -- Let me rephrase the question. St. Michaels has identified you as an expert witness -- as one of their expert witnesses in this case. Were you aware of that? A. Yes. Based on the fact that I'm being deposed, yes. That -- that's correct. Yeah. Q. That's a reasonable conclusion. A. Not to be sarcastic, I just -- I just kind of Q. I guess what I would like to understand is -- is when were you specifically retained as an expert witness for this case? A. Through the legal counsel is who basically brought me in to be the expert witness on it based on the fact that I'm the one that completed the estimate for the Windhams. Q. Okay. And -- and when -- when were you specifically retained to be an expert witness? A. I don't know that offhand. Let's see. I have to see -- I don't know the exact date. Whenever I think they were requesting me deposition, I believe, is probably when I was first notified on it; or possibly shortly before that, asking me for documentation about the church. I don't recall the exact date though. Q. Would it have been after you prepared your first estimate? A. Oh, yes, sir. Yeah. Absolutely. Q. Would it have been in 2020 or 2019? A. It would have been 2020. It had to have been late 2020. Q. Okay. So it doesn't sound like there was a specific engagement letter or anything like that. A. No. No. Not that I'm aware of. Q. What were you retained to do in this case? A. Basically I was retained to give a deposition; is what I've been retained to do based on my findings found at the property. Q. And I'd like to refer you to Exhibit 58; if you could pull that up. (Exhibit No. 58, David Cianchetti's Letter to Mr. Hamilton, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. I have it. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. Do you recognize this document? A. It is -- Yes, I do. Q. What -- what is this document? A. It's basically just referring to a letter I sent to Tyler & Hamilton letting them know what I've done and what I performed for St. Michaels church since they were hired by the Windhams to handle the litigation for her, I believe. Q. And -- and, I guess, the letter indicates that, you know, you inspected the property for hurricane damage with the purpose of providing an estimate detailing the costs and procedures required to restore the properly to its original condition. And it also indicates the contents of your estimate are limited to your opinions related to the costs and repairs and procedures to restore the property to the pre-loss condition is that -A. That's correct. Q. -- all -A. Yes. Q. And is that an accurate statement of what you've been retained as an expert witness to do in this case? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And that's kinda all I was kinda trying to figure out. So let's kinda move on, you know -- you know, to, you know, your expert opinions. Have you formed any opinions in this matter that you intend to offer as evidence at trial or at this deposition? A. I'm sorry repeat that -- repeat the question. MR. HAMILTON: Let me object to the form of the question. MR. WHITLOCK: Okay. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. Have you formed any opinions that -- that you intend to offer at trial in this case or into evidence? MR. HAMILTON: Same -- same objection. You -- you can answer. You can answer. A. I haven't formed any opinions in regards to anything with regards to this process at this time, so -Q. Okay. A. -- no. Q. So you've been identified as an expert witness which means you could provide certain opinion testimony based in your qualifications, experience, personal involvement. And I -- what I would like to understand is just kinda big picture from you on what are the expert opinions and testimony you intend to offer in this case? A. Oh. Based on my knowledge of the damages that I -- I found at the property. Q. Okay. And -- and when you say your knowledge of damage at the property, I guess I just want to know -you've been identified as an expert witness and I want to know what your expert opinions are gonna be specifically. A. Oh, okay. Based -MR. HAMILTON: Let me -- let me -- let me interpose an objection. And maybe -- so we can clarify this. If I may, okay? I mean, David is not a forensic expert principally. Okay. He doesn't -- When you use terms like retained and opinions you intend to offer, that's not how he thinks about it. I mean, he's been hired to give; at -- to prepare an estimate and thus give an opinion as to what the scope of the damage is and the cost to repair the damage. I mean, that's -- I mean, I think that's what you're trying to get at. But he's not -- he's not well versed in this -- in this process to that extent. He's not. BY MR. HAMILTON: Q. Okay. That's the gist of it. I don't need a detailed breakdown, but I need to know what your expert opinions are that you're gonna offer into evidence at trial or at this deposition. And I understand there's an estimate involved, but I'd like to hear from you what those are specifically. MR. HAMILTON: And let me just say this, he doesn't know -- he may not know because I don't know exactly how I'm gonna question him at trial. That's what I'm getting at. Okay. Just the way you're approaching it, it's as if he makes the decision on what he's gonna testify about; and that's just not the way it goes. I; as the lawyer, make that decision. It's certainly gonna be based on his estimates. MR. WHITLOCK: Okay. Sure. As you know, as we're required to do, expert disclosures. We're entitled to ask about what their opinions are gonna be. You're gonna do the same thing with the people we've identified. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. I'm not trying to trick you. Maybe we can go back to the letter; Exhibit 58. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Let's see. Nope. I've got it open all ready. MR. HAMILTON: Alex, when you say "opinion" it would be helpful if you would -- if you would give him some more insight as to what you mean. I don't think he considers that his estimate is an opinion, okay, and that's fundamentally where I think you guys are not on the same page. MR. WHITLOCK: Sure. Let's -- let's follow-up with that. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. Yeah, the letter; 58, you indicated that you determined the cost to repair or procedures to restore the property to the pre-loss condition, correct? A. This is correct. Yes. Q. Okay. Does that mean you determined a replacement cost value and an actual cash value to restore -- Well, replacement cost value to restore the property to its pre-loss condition? A. Yes. That's correct. Q. Okay. And did you determine an actual cash value of plaintiff's dam -- lost or damaged property? A. This is correct. Yes. Q. Okay. Are those opinions reflected in your estimate? A. Those opinions? Yes. Q. Okay. Did you form any opinions as to -- or do you have any opinion -- or did you make any determination on the length of time it would take to restore the property to its pre-loss condition? A. I haven't given that much thought in regards to the period of restoration. No, sir. Q. So, other than offering you opinion or your determination on the replacement cost value and the actual cash value to restore the property to the pre-loss condition, do you have any other opinions that you intend to offer into evidence in this case? A. Not based -- Everything that I have is stated based on the facts that I have in my estimate, what I've seen at the property. That's -- that's what I have and that's what I know. I'm just going be the facts that I know and what I have and what I've seen. Q. Okay. Does the Exhibit 56; the March 30th, 2021, estimate reflect your final opinions in this case? A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes. That's correct. That's the most updated estimate. Yes, sir. Q. Is there anything else you believe you need to do in order to determine the cost and procedures required to restore the property to its pre-loss condition? A. The only changes that I would probably make to the estimate is if the repairs haven't been done, the estimate would probably need to be re-priced at the most current pricing. So since the pricing from the time that I wrote that estimate and the price list now have changed, so And they're probably gone up just due to the recent hurricane activity last year. Q. Okay. Have you been asked to perform any other work in this case? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Have you been asked to review any other documents in this case? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Do you intend to perform any other work after this deposition today? A. Work with regards to what? Can you clarify? Q. This claim specifically. A. I have not been hired to do any additional work, so, no, sir. I don't have any plans on it at this particular tame. Q. Other then your opinion or determination on the cost and procedures to restore St. Michaels property to its pre-loss contain -- condition, do you intend to offer any other opinions or any other of your determinations or -- or -- into evidence or discuss those here today or at trial? A. Just based on my estimate is what I have an opinion on, and what I've seen at the property is the only opinions I could really give one on. If you needed one in regards to period of restoration, that really depends on a contractor being involved. Q. Okay. So I kinda want to talk about how you formed the meth -- methodology you used to be prepare your estimates. You know, your letter references the pre-loss condition. Just explain to me what the pre-loss condition is; what you mean by that? A. The pre-loss condition is basically the way the property would have looked prior to the storm hitting. Q. Okay. What information were you provided related -- or that showed you the pre-loss condition of St. Michaels property? A. Base -- basically you get just that from talking with not only Ms. Windham, but also looking at other rooms within the property to see what kind of building material they had. Some rooms have different materials then others. And if the material's not there; it's been removed, then typically I have to rely on the people that know the church prior to the events to give me the details of what kind of material was used. Q. Okay. So you spoke with, I think you said, Ms. Windham a bit about the pre-loss condition of the property. A. That's correct. Yes. Q. What information did she provide to you? A. Well, she provided me with information; for instance, the sanctuary was pretty much gutted. So I needed to kinda get an idea of what they actually had in those areas. So -- and I believe she had some previous photos of what the ceiling, the walls, and all that typically looked from different previous events. Q. So we can go to Exhibit 55, PDF Page 6. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. I have it. Q. Do you recognize this e-mail? A. (Deponent viewing computer). I do. Yes, sir. This is the photos that were presented to be by Ms. Windham showing me a few pictures of the sanctuary area that they took at a previous date prior to the storm so it gives me an idea of what building material they had. Q. Okay. I guess there appears to have been about 12 of them. I can only see four of them. Do you still have these photos? A. (Deponent viewing computer). Let's see. I'd have to check here real quick. It appears I -- I didn't save those to my computer. It must have been like a DropBox that she sent me those -- that was shared or an album. Q. And -- and what information -- were -- were these -- Let me rephrase that. Were these the only photos of the property that you received that documented it before Hurricane Michael? A. From my recollection. There's some other photos, obviously, as you scroll down to the e-mails that she had provided with regards to like contents and additional items. Q. Yeah. I'm -- I'm just talking about pre-loss photos. A. Yes. Yes. I believe this is correct. That's all of them. Q. And if you recall, what information were you able to gather from these 12 paragraphs? A. We -- basically just the materials that were used on the ceiling, you know, the walls. What they had; if they had paneling, or drywall; whatever they may have had in the sanctuary. So, for instance, in the sanctuary they had -- I only see the black and white; I'll have to refer to my estimate on to, but I -- I believe it was like a plywood sheathing ceiling that was painted over and had a 1 by 2 trim covering the seams. Q. Okay. And I think you briefly referenced maybe discussing with other members of the church about the pre-loss condition of the church. Do you know who they were? A. I don't. If -- if I talked to anyone, it may have been Jack. But I -- I can't recall me having many conversations you him at all. I think I've been talking with Caroline mostly. So I would believe probably a hundred percent of everything I was getting was obtained from Ms. Windham. Q. Okay. And I think we talked -- we eluded to this, but if you go to Page 22 of Exhibit 55. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Q. I'm sorry that's not where I wanted you to go. I meant Page (inaudible) excuse me. THE COURT REPORTER: I'm sorry, page what, sir? MR. WHITLOCK: PDF Page 7 of Exhibit 55. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. Q. Okay. Do you recognize this e-mail and what's in it? A. It looks like -MR. HAMILTON: Alex -- Alex, will you tell me -- I mean, I -- I can't follow that quickly. What's the date of the e-mail? MR. WHITLOCK: Yeah. It's November 19th, 2019. And it's Bates Number St. Michaels PL 004305. MR. HAMILTON: Okay. I happen to be right there. Okay. MR. WHITLOCK: Okay. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. And I'm sorry, sir, do you recognize this e-mail? A. (Deponent viewing computer). It looks like some of the -- Yes, I do. I do recognize it. Q. Okay. What -- what is it? A. I looks like the -- some of the damage from immediately after the storm is what she said sent me some photos of. Q. And I'm gonna refer to you Exhibit 2; if you can pull that up. THE DEPONENT: Exhibit 2. (Exhibit No. 2, Photos of Property, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. And there's six photographs here; I just want to know if you recognize them? A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes. It looks like photos from the -- immediately after the storm. Q. Okay. What -- what did you use these photographs for, if anything? A. If -- if anything, like if a room is gutted I can usually refer back to this to see like, for instance, if they had on the casing around the doors their stain grades; so that's a different kind of wood that you use; that means you have to stain it versus painting it, you know, bi-fold doors and stuff. Basically use it as a reference to what they previously had. Q. And we discussed earlier the photos of the contents as well, but other then the -- those photographs we've just discussed and the photos of the contents, is there any other photographs or documentation you were provided by St. Michaels or Ms. Windham? A. Not that I recall. Everything that you have that I have is right there in your position. Q. Okay. And as far as the content photos; which I believe are on Page -- starting on page -- PDF Page 8 of Exhibit 55. A. (Deponent viewing computer). That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. What -- what did you use these photographs for? A. Basically just to document that they -- you know, they had contents that were damaged, is what she provided to me, so... Q. Were you provided any additional information on the contents specifically? A. Pricing wise, like for the price of the Bibles and the Hymns. I relayed -- I relied on her for the pricing of those contents items. Q. What did she provide you about the pricing? A. (Deponent viewing computer). Let's see. That would be in my estimates. Like on the Hymns and the Bibles and stuff, looks like there's approximately 300 of them. The range around on the average of $67 each. Same thing with the Bishop's chair, she -- she helped obtain those pricings for me. And then on the armoire and the bookcase shelf and stuff, I utilize the pricing within Xactimate for those items. Q. Okay. I understand. Were you given any information for the contents about when they were purchased or the age of the contents? A. I do not. No, sir. Q. Were you provided a more detailed list or anything of -- of the contents? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Kinda staying on just generally the pre-loss condition of the property, I what to know if you reviewed any other documents to kind of evaluate -A. No. Q. -- the pre-loss condition of the property? Did you look at any -A. (Deponent froze) were not even listed on my estimate, so... MR. WHITLOCK: Hold on one second I think you froze. There we go. Nope. Mr. Cianchetti, can you hear me? THE DEPONENT: Yes, I got you. MR. WHITLOCK. Okay. Sorry. You froze for a second so I didn't want -THE DEPONENT: Yeah. I apologize. It could be the hotel WiFi; you never know. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. Sure. So we talked about the photographs and your interview with Ms. Windham. Is there any other information or documents you relied on to kinda evaluate the pre-loss condition of the property? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Did you look at any maintenance records? A. No, sir. Q. Any building records? A. No, sir. Q. It -- it sounds like you may have talked with Jack Lloyd. But as far as you recall you primarily dealt with Ms. Windham. A. It -- it -- I can't even recall even -- I -- I know his name just from the e-mails I think we corresponded with. But I believe -- I believe he's an alderman -elderly gentleman. And I think Carol -- Ms. Windham was the one basically just being my main contact through the whole process. Q. Other then the building itself, did you look at any other structures on the premises or evaluate the other structures on the premises? A. Yes, sir. Yeah. They have a -- they had a gazebo, and I believe a shed, too. Q. What did you do to determine the pre-loss condition of the gazebo and the shed? A. The gee -- the gazebo basically I just looked at the -- non -- nothing with regard to the pre-loss condition. I was just looking at -- because the shed -- or the gazebo's still there so therefore I didn't need to know what the pre-loss condition was in regards to anything that was missing that I didn't have an understanding what was actually used -Q. Okay. A. -- the material was still present. Q. Okay. And I think that covers the documents. Now, you did inspect the property, correct? A. Yes, sir. Q. How many times have you inspected the property? A. Just the one time I inspected it. And then I went back out and met with the adjuster a second time in case he had questions on my estimate. Q. Okay. Do you know approximately when you inspected the property? A. Yes. That was in one of my e-mails there. Let me see -- 'cause I think I had an appointment date that you pointed out on one of the pages. I had -- maybe it was that page that you did not -- wanted me to go to. I think I saw it. (Deponent viewing computer). It was probably the same as what's on my estimate. It's probably that November 6th, I believe it was, or 7th. Q. Okay. And so I'm referring to Exhibit 23 right now. And this was the estimate you prepared after your -9 your inspection in November of 2019. A. (Deponent viewing document. Let's see here. Yes, that's correct. Q. Okay. PDF page -A. Well, 23, you say Exhibit 23? Q. Yes, sir. A. Exhibit 23 is the revised -- that's the second estimate 'cause I have the ACV amounts on it. MR. HAMILTON: Look at it closely, David, it's the same number as the RCV. I mean, let's MR. WHITLOCK: Yeah. And -- and I'll is the one is my understanding, but you can take a look at it. And if you disagree you can let me know. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Twenty-three. Okay. Yeah, you're right I'm sorry. My bad. Yeah, that's the original one. Q. Yeah. And there -- there's a lot of documents and I'm sending you back and forth, so I appreciate you bearing with me. But -- but staying on Exhibit 23; PDF Pages 38 through 247 have a number of photographs. And I would just like to know when those photographs were taken and who they were taken by, if you know? A. I took the photos. And that was the same day I was out inspecting the property. Q. 'Cause the -- the photos indicate date taken -8-2019. But I don't know if that's correct or not; so that's kinda what I was getting at. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yeah. The -- the date on it -- on that must have been wrong when in inputted it, so... Q. Okay. But as far as how the building; the condition was in when you did your inspection in November 2019, these photos are fair and an accurate representation of that. A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. With one exception. I believe if you go to PDF Page Number 237. A. Okay. (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. Q. Were these photos you took or were they the contents photos provided to you by Ms. Windham? A. Those would be the contents photos provided by Ms. Windham. Q. Okay. That's -- that's fair. And I think we talked about it as well in your revised exhibit, the second estimate, excuse me; Exhibit , it's all the same photographs. There weren't any new photographs taken. A. That's correct. Yes. Q. Who -- who was present for your -- for your inspection of the property in November 2019? A. I want to say no one was inspected [sic]. I believe someone came and opened the door for me, and then they basically just told me to kinda lock the door when I left; is basically the way that process worked. So I was there pretty much by myself the whole time. Q. Okay. So let me -- We touched on it briefly earlier, but I kinda just wanna know what you do during and inspection and what your process is. A. Yes. Typically when I show up to the -- the process is when I get there I'll typically take a front picture of the elevation of the risk for the property itself. And then generally I'll start with the roof and then I'll kinda work down. And I usually go front, right, back, left. So if you're facing the building, that's the front. And then as you're still facing the building if you go to your right side, that would be my right elevation, rear elevation, left elevation. At the same time I'm taking photos of the damages I am seeing. And then basically I work my way to the interior of the property. And then I start on one room and kinda work in a formation around the property. Typically in these situations I usually go top down of my -- my estimatics and the way I scope things just because it keeps me organized. So I'll start with the ceiling, work to the walls, work to the floor. And it's kind like putting a puzzle back together is what it is, and that's generally how I do my estimates. Q. So when you're working on each section, what information are you collecting or what data are you collecting? A. Well, first I'm -- you know, first and foremost I'll go in when I sketch the property, that way I have accurate measurements on everything from ceiling height to length, width, missing walls; stuff of that sort is all documented in my sketch. And then at that point then I'm basically -- I'm basically just itemizing what materials were there. So if you're replacing a ceiling, what type of material is the ceiling material made out of. Is there insulation above it? What type of insulation is it? Is there light fixtures on the ceiling that need to be addressed when actually doing the work, and then you work the walls and you kinda proceed that way. Q. And I know you referenced that when you inspected portions of the building had been gutted, correct? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. How do you account for the material that's gone determining what kind of quality or -- or type it was? What's -- what's your process for that? A. If it's not there then typically in this situation I got some photos from Ms. Windham that indicated what the preexisting room looked like prior to the storm so that way I have a idea of what the materials were and were used in the construction. Q. How do you determine what needs to be included in your estimate? A. Just based on experience. I mean, I have, you know, 25 - 26 years experience in dealing with this as well as even additional years before that working for a contractor through high school and college. So it's just a matter of knowing the construction process, how -- how things are built. And basically putting it all together and knowing what Xactimate codes apply to what's in the building and -- and then basically that's how I proceed with my estimate. Q. And in your estimate are you just including items that need to be repaired or replaced? A. Yes, sir. Anything that needs to be addressed with regards to the repair is what I'm including in the estimate. Q. And so that in -- includes kind of associated, you know, repair procedures and things like that. A. Yes. That's correct. Q. How do you make a determination of if an item is damaged? A. Well, if it's gone obviously that's the obvious part, you already know it's damaged. If it's heavily water stained, you know, you just see visible damage. And just through my years of experience you have an idea, especially working so many hurricanes that I have and tornados or large losses, dealing with engineers in the past you learn things as you go along in regards to what actually is damaged. And then basically that's how I do my assessment of the property. I -- I don't change it one way or the other for whether it be an insurance carrier, a homeowner. I -- I look at it the same way every time. Q. And so I believe you -- you said your only inspection was that November 19, 2019 inspection; the November 2019 inspection, correct? A. That was my inspection to complete the estimate, correct. And then I was asked by Ms. Windham; because her adjuster was going back out there and she had asked me if I could join him in case he had questions in regards to my estimate. So I -- I met with I believe it was Glenn; I think his name was. Q. Okay. A. I met with him at a later date. Just walked the property, make sure he didn't have questioned on my estimate. Q. Okay. So -- strike that. So if I'm understanding correct, I mean, you prepared your first estimate based on that inspection, correct? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. And -- and your subsequent inspections incorporated that information. A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. And -- and the only difference between the second inspection -- the second estimate and the first estimate is you calculated actual cash value? A. That's correct. Yes. And that was later on, obviously. Q. And the third estimate I believe you made some revisions to specific items based on an engineer report, correct? A. Absolutely correct. Yes, sir. Q. As far as completing your -- your inspection of the property to prepare your first estimate, was there any information you needed that you didn't have access to? A. No. Everything that we've gone over in this deposition, like with regards to the documents that were provided and what I found during my inspection is all I really needed to make my estimate. Q. And you had full access to the building? A. Yes, sir. That's correct. Q. Is there anything you requested that you were not provided? A. No, sir. Q. So we can kinda move into the second time you were at the property. Do you know when you went out to the property again and met with Glenn? A. I do not know that. No, sir. Q. Do you know if it was in 2019 or 2020? A. I would have to say it's probably early 2020. Q. Okay. And, I guess, did Ms. Windham ask you to go out there and -- and meet with Glenn? A. She did. Yes. She said -- she'd mentioned to me that the adjuster was going out there and she asked if I could be present to make sure he didn't have questions or need clarification on anything in my estimate. Q. And I want to quickly refer you to Exhibit 55, Page 1. A. Fifty-five, Page 1. (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. I have it. Q. Do you recognize that document? A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yeah. There you go. That's the e-mail that was sent on the field adjuster would like to set up an appointment to re-inspect the church. Q. And is that -- that's March 5th, 2020? A. (Deponent viewing computer). That's correct. Q. Is it fair to say that the second time you went to the property to meet with Glenn was somewhere around that date? A. Yeah. Probably would have to be after that date obviously. But, yes, it probably was -- probably within a few weeks of that date if I had to guess. Q. Okay. And I believe you testified Ms. Windham went -- asked you to just go out there in case Glenn had any question, or can you elaborate on that for me? A. That's correct. Yeah. (Deponent viewing computer). It looks -- it looks like by -- by this -- I'm trying to -- Yeah, it looks like I got the e-mail showing -- from Glenn saying that he was trying to meet out there. Yeah. Basically -- basically what I do is I'll write the estimates up for these clients and then in this circumstance she's mentioned that she would like for me to meet with the adjuster out there so I could go ahead and address any questions he my have regards to the estimate. Q. And it's your understanding Glenn was the adjuster working for the insurance company involved in the claim? A. That's correct. Yes. Q. So as far as answering any questions he had about your estimate, I guess what did you guys discuss at this second inspection? A. I recall when I first got there he got out of his car and he was already kinda aggravated. So he was upset right away with the fact that he is having to come back out to the property another time. And then basically he made a lot of -- made a lot of comments in regards to, you know, him having to come back out. And he wasn't happy about it and so forth and so on. I just basically introduced myself and let him know, you know, I'm here in case you have any questions in regards to my estimates. And then from that point forward we kinda walked the property, so... Q. Did you have any discussions or conversations about trying to reach, I guess, maybe an agreement as to like scope of the damage? A. Yeah. Like there's some things like he would just deny right off the bat; for instance, the windows or even the trusses. The reason being is he was -- he was basically, No, that's not damage from the storm. And I just told him -- I said, Well, okay, that's what I included in my estimate so... And let him be, so... Q. Did you have any discussions tying to reach an agreement as to the cost of certain items or -- or the value of the estimates or -- or what they were gonna arrive at? A. No. We're both working, I believe, off the Xactimate estimates. So Xactimate pricing is set so there's really no discussion regarding the pricing. The pricing should be the same if you're using the same on the price list. Q. So I guess just generally it sounds like you were just assisting St. Michaels to kinda convey your position on -- on the estimate, correct? A. That's correct. Yes. I'm just pointing out items that I say and the reason why I had it in my estimate is -- and that's it. Q. Okay. Were you kinda helping out adjust the claim? It sounds like you were doing what Glenn was doing just on the other side. MR. HAMILTON: Object to the form. A. No. I wasn't acting as a public adjuster. So I don't have a contract to be a public adjuster, nor would I even do that. So that's why I will go out there. And if he has questions on my estimate, I'll answer questions on my estimate. And that's the only reason I was there. Q. Okay. Did you revise your estimate at all based on this second walk-through of the property? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Other then Glenn was there anyone else at the property during this second in -- or walk-through? A. I don't believe so. I'm trying to think. There must have been someone that let us in. But I can't recall who it was or if they stuck around. Q. Okay. Did you have anymore contact with Glenn after this walk-through? A. Not to my recollection. No. Q. Other then -- Did you provide Glenn with a copy of your estimate? A. He already had a copy of my estimate that was provided to the insurance carrier from Ms. Windham; is what I would gather. Since he did have a copy of it already, I didn't have to provide it to him. Q. And then other than answering his questions did you provide Glenn any other information? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Do you, I guess, Well you -- let me strike that. Did Glenn provide you with any information or any documentation? A. Not that I'm aware of. No, sir. Q. Okay. I kinda, want to talk about other documents you maybe have relied on in -- in creating your estimate. I know you had Glenn's estimate; the ICA estimate we discussed earlier. A. Yes. Q. Okay. Did you rely on that to create your estimate? A. No. A lot of times what I'll do is I'll write my estimate up in detail and then basically I will look over the carrier's estimate to see if they're including something in the estimate that I did not have in mine. So if the insurance company is already paying for something. So if I've overlooked something then typically I may add that into the estimate. But I do -- I do not rely on their estimate one bit, I rely on my inspection of what I found. Q. Okay. And we talked about the engineering reports. Did you review -- We talked about the engineering report that came out recently, I'd like to refer you to Exhibit 50, and then PDF Page Number 3. (Exhibit No. 50, Sonny Gulati Cover Letters, marked for identification). THE DEPONENT: (Deponent viewing computer). PDF Number 3. Okay. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. And this is a forensic engineering report by Florida Testing & Environmental, Inc., dated July 1st, 2020. Have you seen this document before? A. (Deponent viewing computer). I have not. Q. Okay. Did you rely on this document at all? A. Not the entire report. I just got the -7 basically that other page that you had reflected on earlier that had mentioned that they'd required the trusses to be replaced. But I have -- I have not looked at the entire report. No, sir. Q. With -- with respect to creating your first and second estimates, did you rely at all on any of the Florida Testing & Environmental reports? A. On my first and second estimates? No, sir. Q. And the only reason I ask is on Exhibit 58 the last sentence-- last sentence refers to -- Well, I'll wait 'til you get there. A. Yeah. I'm there. Yes, sir. Q. It just says "The facts and data used in generation of the opinions contained within that report were derived from my inspection of the property as well as review of the report prepared by Florida Testing & Environmental, Inc., dated July 1st 2020." So maybe you didn't use it, I -- I don't know. I just want to know if you did, what was it used for? A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yeah. That -- that letter and stuff was basically after talking with Clark and them to kinda give they something in writing to let them know exactly what I entailed, what my job or my duties were working with Ms. Windham on the church. Q. Um-hmm. A. -- and then also after the fact that I received that little synopsis of the engineering report, so... Q. Yeah. 'Cause this -- this letter was produced before the second engineer report and your thrid estimate came out. And, I guess, my understanding is you did not use the Florida Testing & Environmental to prepare your first or second estimate, correct? A. This is correct. Yes. Q. Did you rely on the insurance proceeds at all in preparing your estimate or determining the scope of costs? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Have you reviewed any of the pleadings that have been filed in this litigation? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. And we've talked about some of your interviews and documents and things like that. I kinda just want to know if you relied on information from any other sources. You know, did you consult with any other authoritative literature to help create your estimates or prepare your -- or form you opinions in this case? A. No, sir. Just using my 25 - 26 years of experience and my background is all I utilize. Yes, sir. Q. And I think you said Xactimate has codes and things like that. Can you just elaborate on that for me? A. Xactimate has codes. Q. Yeah. I think you A. I don't recall that. Yeah. What's that what's that entail? Q. When you identified something I believe you referenced entering certain codes or numbers in the Xactimate. A. No. I haven't -- I didn't mention that at all. There-- you can add line items if it's a building code, but Xactimate doesn't provide you codes and stuff of that sort. Are you talking about in regard to building codes or -- I'm sorry, I don't follow. Q. Let -- let me -- let me clarify. When you enter information into Xactimate how how do you do that? A. Yeah. You just enter in the line items that a particular has. So you talking about like to the Xactimate like building -- like the reference codes in regards to the estimate writing? Q. Yes. That -- that sounds more accurate. And I'm just curious what that is. A. Okay. Yeah. So basically like in Xactimate there's, I don't know, probably 100 - 200,000 different codes in there. So basically depending on what category you're working with; if you're doing drywall and it's a 5/8th inch drywall then you have an option of -- you have a building -- like the line item code of drywall; which would be D-R-Y. And then at that point you would go into a select code. So you have a category code; which would be drywall. The selector code would be like the thickness of the drywall. And then you have activity codes; that could be remove, remove and replace, replace only, install. It just gives you options that you can do within the -- the estimate. Q. Okay. And Xactimate, I guess, populates the values. Is that -- is that accurate? A. That's correct. Yeah. Just -- with Xactimate what you do is you -- when you start an estimate you plug in there like your address and stuff and then typically you set up your preferences. So based on the zip code that you put in there for the location of the property it will utilize that price list for whatever particular month you're utilizing it. So, for instance, if in this case I was probably using the price list from the date of my inspection so it's the most accurate at that time. And then what it does, based on those codes when you put it in there, it will put in the actual labor and material costs for that particular zip code in that particular month. Q. Okay. And -- and that answers my question. I appreciate it. A. Okay. Q. So just about other information, I mean, did you rely on any Florida Statutes, Florida Administrative Codes or rules in preparing your estimates? A. Just -- the only codes that you really -- you deal with in regards to this property that I could see is maybe upgrading the windows to the most recent building codes and that's it -Q. Okay. A. -- everything else would be pretty standard for the most part. Q. And I think we discussed too -- before I move on, you did at some point receive the HAAG report before you made your first estimate. A. I -- I do. And I do not -- I'm sorry, I don't have a copy of it. But I remember specifically that's why I -- I did the trusses and stuff in the sanctuary -Q. Okay. THE COURT REPORTER: I'm sorry, I didn't get the end of his -- his answer; you spoke over him. You got the trusses in the sanctuary and then I didn't hear what you said after that. THE DEPONENT: Yeah. That -- that based on that report I -- I know I've looked at it at one point before because that's when I based my decision on the trusses. Not only did I know could I tell they were leaning, but I remember the report specifically stating those trusses need to be replaced. And that's how I wrote my estimate up to document it based on what my report was saying and what I was visually seeing. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. Okay. Thank you, sir. A. Yeah. Q. Did you have to make any assumptions in order to prepare your estimate? A. Assumptions. Assumptions is kind of a -- I would say no, you don't make any assumptions. Basically what I do is I try to visibly -- I basically write for what I visibly can see is damaged. So, for instance, with regards to the trusses, I'm writing for the trusses that I can physically see during the inspection and based on the report, so.... So I didn't assume anything outside the realm of what I could see. Q. Okay. Was there any information you needed to complete or prepare your estimates that you didn't have? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. So I kinda wanna talk a little bit more specifically about the replacement cost and actual cash values just to get an understanding of how you arrived there. A. Okay. Q. So all of your estimates determine the replacement cost value, correct? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. And I'll ask a dumb question, but can you just tell me what replacement cost value is? A. Yes. Replacement cost value is basically the cost to do the necessary job at today's cost is what it is. So it's the full cost of everything not taking into consideration any depreciation, or age of an item, or anything of that sort. It's just basically the -- the bottom line of the total amount; that's your starting point. Q. That -- that -- I want to refer to Exhibit 56, and maybe we can probably stay in this one as we go through today. A. Okay. Q. Let me know when you have it up. A. (Deponent viewing computer). I do. Yes, sir. Q. This is your third estimate, correct? MR. HAMILTON: Alex? MR. WHITLOCK: Yes? MR. HAMILTON: I don't know how much more you have. Could we -- I mean, if you're gonna be just a couple minutes, that's fine. But if you're gonna be longer than that I need to take a short break. MR. WHITLOCK: Oh, yeah. No. That -that's absolutely fine. Five, ten; what do you guys need? MR. HAMILTON: I'm good with five minutes. MR. WHITLOCK: Okay. five -4 MR. HAMILTON: Maureen would like ten, so we'll take ten. MR. WHITLOCK: I've -- I've been instructed to take ten. MR. HAMILTON: All right. MR. WHITLOCK: Thank you. THE COURT REPORTER: We just have to wait for the videographer. THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the record at 11:40. (Brief break). THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the record at 11:51. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. Mr. Cianchetti, we can resume. And I guess we walked through your methodology about how you determined which line items need to go into Xactimate. And that's based on your inspection, the documents and -- and -- and your best review of the property, correct? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. Now, we touched on this briefly earlier, but Xactimate once you enter in the line items it'll -- it'll populate values, correct? A. That it correct. Yes, sir. Q. So it'll provide the cost to remove, replace, the tax, overhead and profit into the -7 A. That is correct. Q. -- into the estimate. A. That is correct. Yes, sir. Q. And are those values determined by the price list you selected? A. That's correct. Yeah. The price list is selected just based on the zip code of the actual location that you're at based on what you put in the estimate. So you put the address -- (Deponent froze). MR. WHITLOCK: Oops. THE COURT REPORTER: He froze. MR. WHITLOCK: Yeah. He came right back on last time, so let's just give him a few more -THE DEPONENT: Oh, there we go. MR. WHITLOCK: There we go. THE DEPONENT: I'm sorry, did you hear that? THE COURT REPORTER: No, sir. I got up to the estimate that you put in and then that was it. A. Yeah. That's okay. Yeah, so based on the address and the zip code that you put into the estimate for the location of the property, Xactimate will automatically populate the most recent price list for that particular zip cost. So -- and then the pricing's just based on what Xactimate has it as. Yes, sir. Q. So Xactimate, I guess, creates price lists based on the area a property is located? A. That is correct. Yes. So, for instance, Florida may be more expensive then Mississippi. But then New York may be more expensive then somewhere else for the same kind of materials and labor. Q. And, I guess, Miami could be more expensive then, you know -- you know, Nevada, Florida or something like that. A. Oh, yeah. Ab -- absolutely. Yes. Absolutely. And parts of like within zip -- one zip code to adjoining zip code right next to it; it could be a few blocks away, the pricing could be drastically changed just based on that zip code, so... Q. You also then select the date for the price list and that tries to give you a more current pricing? A. That's correct. That's correct. Yes. Xactimate will update their pricing every month. So usually in the beginning of the month within the first two days there'll be an updated price lists. So typically when I go out to inspect the property; like, for instance, in this case if it was November 2019, then typically I'm usually using that month that I'm particularly right there. So it's the most recent pricing at that time. Q. Are you able to select different price lists in Xactimate? A. All day long. Yes, sir, you can. You can manipulate -- they're like -- you can't go forward in the future; you can only go back. Q. Sure. It would be pretty cool if you could go forward in the future, but you can go back and get older prices. A. Yes. You'd have a lot more depositions if you could go forward 'cause people would be manipulating it more then they usually do. So, yes, sir. Q. That's fair. And -- and selected the November '19 price list A. I'm almost positive of it. I could double check. It'll say it on the top of that estimate. So let me get in there and I'll tell you for sure -Q. Yeah. Of course. A. -- the initial date. It was -- was that 56, right? Q. That is your most recent one. A. (Deponent viewing computer). So, for instance, on the -- I don't think I changed the price list on any of these. So on the very first page it will show on there, price list right underneath like the claim number, date of loss, and then it has the price list. FLP; which is like Florida; PC being Panama City 8X don't really know what that is. November 19; 2019. That gives you the month and the year of the price list that you're utilizing. Q. And if your first and second estimate also included the same FLPC8X November 19, that means you use the November '19 price list for those as well. A. That's correct. So if you ever see that number change, then you know specifically some's changing the price list on you. And that'll usually tell -- you'll see differences in the prices along from one estimate to the other on the total. Q. Okay. And -- and we discussed earlier how you determined which line items need to be included, you know, documents and inspection. Do -- do you have to account for the type of material or quality of the material when you plug that information into Xactimate? A. You do. Yes. You have to know what kind of material you're dealing with; like -- especially like drywall, usually you'll have 1/2 inch drywall on the walls, but 5/8th inch drywall on the ceiling. So you specify what code you would like to use in there. Yes, sir. Q. If -- For your estimate did you attempt to use or -- or use the same quality of material that was present at the property that you then added into your line item, correct? Is that A. That's -- that's correct. Yes, sir. Yeah. I'm utilizing what I see at the property. And then that way it's the most accurate estimate hopefully at that particular time. Q. If any of the quality of materials selected were inaccurate or should have been better or worse quality would you agree that there would need to be some revision made to account for that? A. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Sure. Q. Did your estimate include any items that were new or -- or not damaged by the hurricane? A. Oh, not off the top of my head. I can't recall that. There's a lot of items in that estimate. So I want to say everything in there was probably -- I don't recall anything being new or -- off my recollection. No. Q. All right. If your estimate included something that was not either damaged or not actual present in the building, would you agree that there would need to be a revision made? A. Correct. Yes. Q. Okay. What about if you had duplicative line items? A. Yes. Same thing. Yeah. If you duplicate something by accident; human error or whatever it may be, then obviously it would not need to be in there. Q. So, and -- and, I guess, as an example, if you could look at Line Item 31 of Exhibit 56; which is on PDF Page 4. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. Q. And that's a -- I think -- I think that means remove and replace ductwork system has a total of $7,681.86. A. (Deponent viewing computer). That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. And then if you were to look at Line item 450; which is on PDF Page 31. And let me know when you're there. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes, I'm there. Q. Does that appear to be a duplicative charge or is that something else? A. (Deponent viewing computer). That is a obviously a duplicative charge. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. So you would agree any -- any duplicative line items would need to be revised and accounted for, correct? A. Absolutely. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. And I know we talked -- when you inspected the property large portions of the billing had been gutted; the drywall, insulation, ceiling had been removed. A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. And I know that your estimate can -- can factor in the value for the removal as well as the replacement; is that correct? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. Did your estimate include removal charges for any items that had already been removed or did you try to account for that? A. Let's see here. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes, it accounted for the removal of the items as well. Q. All right. And so does your estimate have charges for removal of material that had already been removed? A. (Deponent viewing document. Yes. Q. Okay. Would you agree that, you know, if that labor was fee or -- or something that St. Michaels didn't pay for, would there need to be a revision made there? MR. HAMILTON: Object to form. A. I think you -- from the insurance standpoint and from all the thousands and thousands of claims I've had, if you have a loss the insurance company is required to pay you by law for the repairs being made. So, say, for instance -- say, for instance, you being the homeowner you have damage to your house and you want to do the drywall repairs yourself. You're not charging because you're not a professional drywall installer, but if you removed all the drywall yourself, you're still entitled to that money. So that's why it's indicated in that estimate. So whether -- whether they did the work themselves or not, it's still entitled to that. You can deal with a farmer or a rancher that does not deal with contractors; he likes to put on all his own roofs and all that stuff. So any profit and all that stuff's built into the price. You can't profit off the insurance company, but if you're doing the work, you're still entitled to the labor cost that a professional would have had. So that's how insurance companies work. Q. Would -- would that be your position if it wasn't St. Michaels that performed the removal, it was some other entity did it for free? A. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. 'Cause it is still owed by the insurance company in my understanding and the way I've always handled claims and the way the policy reads, so... Q. So you included that to just -- It's your understanding that St. Michaels should have been compensated for that under the insurance policy; is that accurate? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. And, I guess, is it fair to say you wrote the estimate just kinda keeping in mind what insurance companies obligations are and -- and to help St. Michaels out? A. No. Not to help to St. Michaels. Basically my MR. HAMILTON: Object to form. MR. WHITLOCK: You can answer. A. Okay. Yeah. So, for instance, I don't write the estimate based what I think the insurance company's necessarily gonna do. Based on my experience on how I write my estimates is based on what I see out there and what I know is damaged is how I'm gonna write the estimate. Now, I know the insurance company's side more so then this little aspect and being deposed and all that stuff much better. But I know it's owed to the client. So I know that's how the policy reads. So -- but I don't write my estimate based on trying to help out the church by no means. I'm just writing the estimate based on what I know is damaged. What needs to be done to actually correctly do the work. Q. I think I understand. O&P, can you explain what that stands for, and and let me know what that is? A. Yes. O&P is basically overhead and profit. So basically on an estimate if -- for instance, if you had just a roof that's being replaced, generally that O -- that overhead and profit is only added if there's a general contractor involved on a large scale. Okay, if you're just doing a roof, it's just a roofer; he's not coordinating a bunch of different individual tradesmen or additional item. You don't have to coordinate those people to come out at a certain time to do their job therefor they would not be entitled to the additional overhead and profit. There is -- Based on the price in Xactimate it includes overhead and profit already in the pricing. But on a large-scale job where you're having to coordinate different trades and all that stuff, that overhead and profit that you see on there is what they really consider general contractor overhead and profit. It's additional fees and expenses and that's how they make their money above and beyond for contracting out for subcontractors. Q. Okay. So overhead and plof -- profit is some accounting for what a general contractor would be required to -- kinda their -- their value added to it, I guess. A. Absolutely. Correct. Q. So that would apply to kind of the construction repair-work-type, type line items. A. That it correct. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. So it wouldn't apply to -- I know in general conditions you have like Dumpster rental. There wouldn't be an overhead and profit for Dumpster removal, correct? A. Not necessarily. So it -- it depends. Like if they own their Dumpsters and stuff, then yes. Then you would have to pay them for that because they're not getting if for a set price so that's how they make their money. For instance, like if you have a water mitigation company that comes out and does -- puts in fan and dehumidifiers in there, the own all those fans and dehumidifiers so they have to maintain those. So there's always the cost to do that, so therefore that is what the overhead and profit helps with that overhead cost that they would incur typically. Q. I think I understand. And then, you know, if I were to look at PDF Page 30 of Exhibit 56; which is your contents section. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Right. Q. Contents doesn't have overhead and profit; what's the reason for that? A. It -- it's just a personal property item. I mean, if you go out to Target and stuff and buy a book, they're not gonna charge you a percentage on top of it. Obviously you have to pay your sales tax. And plus it's already marked up anyways. So typically contents items you would not have contractor overhead and profit. Your contractor's not involved with any of that. Q. Okay. So the -- the personal property stuff wouldn't usually have overhead and profit; is that fair? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. Are there any items that have -- you know what -I'll tell you what, let's go to Page 4 of Exhibit 36 [sic]. THE DEPONENT: Okay. (Deponent. Viewing document). Okay. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. You can see in the attic it has sections for electrical, HVAC, and plumbing. A. Right. Q. You know, I know those require kinda special licenses to design and install, but, you know, are those items you would need a bid from an electrician or AC guy to -- to account for, or -- or how do you get a best estimate on those costs? A. (Deponent viewing computer). Basically with regards to the electrical that I did there, I was really just doing kinda like the square footage above the actual sanctuary for the trusses because the wires go through it so they'd have to re-wire that section. And actually while I'm looking at that, that should actually be higher since the latter engineering report reflected to replace all the trusses, so therefore all the electrical would have to be replaced; so that's low. But basically the prices are set by Xactimate number, but you can make that argument for anything. So, for instance, if you had electrical or an electrician come in and say, Hey, it's gonna cost $1200 to do the electrical, and then basically -- and he's not associated with the contractor. Or a water mitigation company, for instance, came in and did the water mitigation and all that stuff, you have a set bill, you're not gonna add overhead and profit on that set bill because the work is already completed by someone. Q. I understand. I know there's some other things like other conditions. If you go up to like tree debris, and I'm guessing where those cost type changes, how do you factor those costs? A. Really it's just a guesstimate, just based on the size of the tree, really. So, you know, it was a pretty large tree that was right there on the side of the church. And, you know, it depends on your tree companies; a large tree could go anywhere from 2,000 to 15,000 depending on what kind of equipment they have to use and stuff. So it's basically -- the figure that I have on there is really not a whole lot for tree debris removal, but... Q. Okay. Did you observe a tree on the building or is this just -A. That's from that one individual picture that I believe was obtained from Ms. Windham showed -- I think the ones that we showed previously, that it had a big, large tree that was snapped in half right there on the right-hand side of the building it appeared. Q. And so for -- And we kinda touched on that for, you know, items that might be bid on or done by a separate contractor or be -- you know, if it was done for a different price there would need to be some revision made to account for the actual price incurred, occurred? A. Absolutely. Yeah. If they had a tree bill that I was not aware of and they paid $1200 or $2500, then obviously that -- that would be the actual cost of what was incurred, so... Q. Okay. The last -- just kinda getting through real quick just so I understand how it's made, there's like a general condition section at the very end -A. Okay. Q. -- on PDF Page 31. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. Q. I'm just kinda curious; Line Items 40 through 59 how you made a determination for these costs? A. On line -MS. DODGE: Lines items what now? MR. WHITLOCK: I'm sorry, 40 -- 450 through 459 on PDF Page 31. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Okay. Well, the duct system obviously need to be replaced; same thing with the furnace unit. The final cleaning is just basically when you get done with the project typically they're gonna have -- do one final dusting and cleaning of everything so that way it's ready for people to move back in. Supervision, usually on these larger products -projects; especially commercial projects, you have to typically have more supervision on the projects. So those additional project managers and stuff accounts for their labor of having to be on an project that they necessarily normally would not have to be. Some larger jobs they're required to be on there so that accounts for their supervisor -- supervision fees. General laborer is just like general cleanup everyday after -- after their work to make sure the areas re -- you know, especially around the property and stuff like that, or no hazards for people or bystanders walking by, riding bikes; anything of that sort, everything in that sense is being cleared for hazards. Toilets obviously is just so -- especially if there's repairs in the bathrooms and stuff like that, that way they're not using the facilities on property; you have an out -- out -- and outhouse out there. The Lock Box is just basically so that way the owners don't have to come over and continually day in and day out to let crews in. And the just the storage containers is basically to store any contents during that particular time during their restoration process. So... Q. And -- and I know like for the commercial supervision and the storage containers it looks like you accounted for ten months of those each. A. (Deponent viewing computer). Yes. And basically it has two containers for ten months. Basically I was looking at the period of restoration at that time maybe being maybe about ten months. Just depending on how long it's been already since the repairs will be started. And basically that -that will fluctuate anyway in regards to depend on exactly how many month it would take to do the work. So... Q. But, I guess, when -- when you created your estimate, ten months was kind of your period of restoration? A. It was kind of the standard at the time; just for the period -- because you have a very limited amount of contractors. Florida's very tough on contractors. You have to be licensed in the state to do work. You can't just have an out-of-state Florida -- Georgia or Alabama guy coming over, so -- with a truck saying he could do the work. And being -- he'd be arrested. So basically you have to rely on whether local contractors or contractors that are licensed within the State of Florida. So there's some delays in that process too, so... Q. I guess you just kinda take all of the factors and that's how you came up with your replacement cost value amount; is that fair -- I mean, everything on the line items they get totaled and that's replacement cost? A. That's right. Xactimate does all that for you, so... Q. And then I would also like to know about actual cash value. And it looks on Page 32 of Exhibit 56 there's an item total; which is my understanding is replacement cost. And then actual cash -- or ACV total; is my understanding is actual cash value total; is that accurate? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. What -- what is actual cash value? A. Actual cash value is basically depreciation that's being applied to certain items that wear. For instance, on a roof if you have a 30-year roof and it's -- you know, if it's 15 years old, then typically you could depreciate it by 15 years old -- being 15 years old. Or if it's even eight years old but it looks like it's 15 years old, then you could adjust the deprecation within the -- within Xactimate to say, Yes, it's eight years old, but it's not an average eight-year old roof; it's really worn. You could indicate that in there Q. Is that the -A. -- and it calculates it for you. Q. So depreciation depends on, I mean, what the specific item is? Like roof shingles might deteriorate A. Correct. Q. -- or depreciate at a different rate then a wooden table, you know, just guessing? A. Yeah. Like paint on a house you may have to do more often then you would have to do a roof, so... Drywall insulation, if you think about it, you don't -- you own a house you don't say, Hey, I haven't changed my ceiling in a while, I'm gonna change our the drywall; they don't do that. So it's typically just the wearable services that you would have to constantly maintain would be a depreciated item. Q. And, I guess, the age of the item might factor into depreciation; a one-year-old roof probably has more depreciation then a five-year-old roof? A. It'll be the opposite. The one-year-old roof would have less deprecation, yeah, then a five-year-old roof. That's correct. But it also deals with not only just the age, but also the condition of it when you look at it. So if a -- if it looks older something of that sort then obviously you can adjust the depreciation to reflect -Q. Okay. A. -- so deprecation's really -- it -- it's -- you could go out and estimate something and depreciate it, and I could depreciate it and it'll be two worlds apart, you know. There's noth -- nothing set in stone or that, so... Q. Do items have like kinda estimated useful life; if I can use that term? A. They do. Yeah. In Xactimate, like if you put in there -- you can change the depreciations from just basic percentage, or you can do years. Or you can do a percentage amount; you can put on three 20, 30, 40, 50 percent. You can max out the depreciations on there. Some carriers will require you not to go over like 75 or 80 percent of the value on depreciation. But, yeah. If you -- typically if you put in there like age, and then in your line items when you're putting in the line item for like paint or whatever it may be, they'll have a deprecation where you just hit the age on there, put it in there and it already has the useful life built into Xactimate and it will automatically calculate it for you. Q. And so that -- so roof shingles could have a 15-year useful life, but a wooden bench could have a five-year useful life. A. Absolutely. Yeah. Or like brick and metal could have, you know, 50 or 60 years. Correct. Q. So, I guess, depreciation applies to like the items or materials that were -- Well, damage in the storm that need to be repaired or replaced; is that -- Oops, you froze. THE DEPONENT: You froze. MR. WHITLOCK: Oh, you're back. THE DEPONENT: Okay. There you go. I'm back. Sorry. MR. WHITLOCK: I'll pick up -THE DEPONENT: You were saying the age. BY MR. WHITLOCK: Q. Yeah. Your estimate has line items, some of which -- many of which are for materials or items that were damaged and need to be repaired or replaced, correct? A. That's correct. Anything that you're associating within the estimate you would apply the depreciation to, correct. Yes. Q. And I guess have it considers the age, useful life and -- and what material or item -- item was. A. That's right. Yes, sir. Q. What did you rely on to determine depreciation in this case? A. In this case typically it was so far after the fact I was just kinda going by -- had to review some of my previous photos to kinda look at it and just kinda get a guesstimate on it, really, is what it is. It wasn't do a true science behind why I did what I did on it, it's just -- you know, if it looks like it's in fairly good condition, or if it looks like it needed some maintenance at the time then I depreciated it higher. Q. Well, and, I guess, you had first inspected the property about a year after Hurricane Michael, correct? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. And the building had been gutted by that point. A. Yeah. Parts of it. Yes, sir. Q. And -- and so did that present any challenge in trying to determine depreciation? A. A little bit in that sense. But I basically just do -- if it's got like a 10- to 12-year life expectancy I may do a higher depreciation on it -- typically on it. So depending on -- unless I've -- you know, I'll look at the previous photos and -- that they've given like prior to, and if it looked like it was in good condition based on what I could see in that, that that's how I kinda based my decision on that. Q. And -- and, I guess, is that how you -- How did you determine the age of the damaged materials that you included in the estimate? A. Like on the painting and such, you can kinda tell if the paints older and stuff just by if it's starting to yellow out. Or if you look -- you know, it's got a lot of finger mat prints or dinginess to it, you can kinda get an idea just based on the experience of looking at it all the time you'll have an idea, well, you know, that needs to be painted. And then that may fluctuate the depreciation a little higher. Q. Is -- is there any information you needed or -or would have liked to have to determine depreciation? A. If -- if you needed a real hard figure on it and that was the big case on it, and that was what was being -- you know, if they -- I would call and say, Hey, I really need to know what's the depreciation amount on it. Then I'd probably get into more detail and -- how old was your paint? How old was this? How old was that? But based on this situation I was utilizing mostly my memory of the property as well as my photos and stuff to make my determination. Q. I think you said it wasn't really a scientific process; it was kind of a best guess. A. Yeah. Absolutely. And that's the way it is in every circumstance you go to. Like it -- like any estimates. My estimates and the carrier's estimate are two different worlds. And you can have six other people go out there, none of their estimates are gonna be alike, so... Q. How -- What I wanted to know is how specifically you calculated for depreciation? I mean, was it specific formulas or some type of method you used to calculate depreciation? A. No. Like if a -- if the paint looks worn and stuff, then I may say it's, you know, five years old; so that's kinda like longer than the life expectancy of it. And then the computer does the rest of it; Xactimate calculates it. Q. So for -- for each line item did you enter in information into Xactimate that would allow Xactimate to determine? A. Correct. Absolutely. Yes. You'd have to go through the line items, and actually put in the age of it and then let the -- let the program do the rest; is what it does. Q. Okay. I'll give you a second to drink. Is the information you input into Xactimate, is determined depreciation reflected in any of your estimates? A. No. I don't think it reflects it. Let me see on the estimate. To see if it shows any of that. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. (Deponent viewing computer). Yeah. It doesn't reflect like anything on their like ages or anything like that on there, no, or percentages, so... Q. Is -- is there any record of the ages or percentages you utilize or input into Xactimate to determine actual cash value or (inaudible)? A. I'm sorry? Q. Okay. Is there any record or -- or documents or any notes that would reflect the information you put into Xactimate to enable it to calculate actual -- or depreciation, excuse me? A. No. There wouldn't be really any notes on it, per se, because basically I just went through the estimate and applied depreciations throughout. (Deponent viewing computer). So, it looks like -- I'm trying to go through here and see how it was applied in here, 'cause I didn't have ages on a lot of it, so a lot of it was just a percentage base, based on what I could tell on it. So -- and useful life -- life of it, so... No. Doesn't -- Let me see -- there may be a different report you could probably print out that would maybe give you -- It may give you the amount of depreciation per line item, but I don't know if it will actually give you a percentage or anything of that sort on it. Q. And did -- did you apply depreciation to individual line items or did you just apply it to the item totals at the end? A. No. It should be -- let me see here because a lot of stuff you don't apply depreciation to, so... (Deponent viewing computer). Yeah. It's only on the wearable items that would probably be depreciated. So, like I even depreciated like some of the rafters and stuff; which you normally wouldn't normally do.Let's see. Yes. It's based on an individual basis. I didn't just do a lump sum across the whole thing, so... Q. But, I guess, your estimate reflects the line item amount of depreciation required, correct? A. I'm sorry, one more time. You kinda broke up a little bit. I'm sorry. Q. Oh, I apologize. It -- it does not appear your estimates; any of the three, indicate the depreciation applied to each specific line item. A. That's correct. No. It does not in that -- in that format that I printed out for him. There is -- I mean, I could print out one that'll show you probably the individual ones per line item too if you guys needed that, so... Q. Okay. Is there any record you have about the inputs you used to calculate depreciation for the individual line items? A. No. It was basically -- the only report you would get would be basically just like the report you're seeing with the estimate there, but it'll have a separate line item and it'll show depreciation. It just shows the amount on it, so... But there's no where -- I don't -- I don't now of a report that'll actually print out like what percentage was put in there or what the age is, or anything of that sort, so... Q. When you -- you did not determine depreciation during your first inspection, correct? A. That's correct. Yeah. My -- my -- when I was hired it was basically just to provide an estimate for the replacement cost. And that's what I did. Q. So did you first, I guess, calculate depreciation through Xactimate when you prepared your second estimate? A. Yes. The -- yes. The second estimate, yes. That was requested when I was in talks with Mr. Hamilton, Ms. Dodge; and they were requesting, Hey, can you give us one that reflects the actual cash value. And that's when I went through the estimate and applied it. Q. And -- and that was based on, I guess, of your memory of the inspection and the photographs you have? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. And as far as when you have to kinda use a best gate -- guess to figure out depreciation or -- or use a percentage, is there an industry standard you would rely on to determine the -- the best amount to use or is it -you explain it to me. A. There is not an industry standard that I know of. And from all the carriers I've worked with in the past it's just a matter of use your best judgement. It's kinda the way they look at it for the most part. And that's just kinda the way I -- I proceeded with this one. Q. I think I probably asked you this, other then potentially a version of the report that indicates the depreciation applied to each individual line item, it doesn't sound like there's anything else we can review to know how those numbers were arrived at. A. Not really. Not to my understanding. There was a bunch of different -- you can print off a ton of different reports per each one. You can print off like just the scope. And it'll just give you the scope and the square footages that you did with no pricing. There's a bunch of different reports that are available within Xactimate, but I don't -- I'm not aware of one that will just show off just what the actual depreciation amounts were or ages. No. Q. And -- and I guess if -- if new or better information was available to give you information on either the age or the product, its useful life, or the type of material, is it potentially possible that a revision would have to be made to depreciation? A. Oh, absolutely. MR. HAMILTON: Object to form. THE DEPONENT: I'm sorry. MR. HAMILTON: I just made an objection. THE DEPONENT: Oh. Okay. A. Absolutely. If you gave me exact ages on stuff. But then still you have to kinda go by the condition of it too. So it -- it make -- it may reflect a little difference in it. Absolutely. So, and also too, you know, like the framing and stuff that I applied depreciation, I mean, normally you're not gonna replace your framing and stuff, so -- the depreciation was applied to some of that as well, so... It would definitely fluctuate up and down. Q. And these might be included in it, but does Xactimate account for deterioration or obsolescence when determining actual cash value or is that kind of part of depreciation? A. Obsolescence would be basically it's no longer made, I would say. So the at that point you'd have to replace it. So I guess you would. It's really just a judgement call on how to apply the depreciation, so... Q. Okay. And I think that's all I had on that. I am gonna wrap it up. I think we've reviewed and talked about all the documents that you've received and what you reviewed to prepare your opinions and form your estimates. I mean, is there anything else that you reviewed or discussed that we haven't talked about today? A. No, sir. I think we -- we covered it pretty good. Q. Okay. And I know there was some dispute about talking about your opinions in this case, but as far as your determination and your opinion on what it would take to restore the property to its pre-loss condition, did we -- I mean, is there anything else you want me to know while we're sitting here and talking about it? A. The only -- I don't have a necessary opinion. I don't work that way. So I kinda go based on facts and what I see. And so I guess my estimate would be my opinion on what I think is damaged and what needs to be done. So, absolutely. Q. Okay. And -- and is your estimate also your opinion as to the actual cash value of -- of St. Michaels property or it's lost or damaged property? A. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. Is there anything else that's been asked of you in this case that we haven't covered today? A. No, sir. Q. Okay. Now, you've never testified at trial before, correct? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. So I suppose a Courts never rejected any expert testimony you intended to offer, correct? A. That would be correct. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. Have you ever been convicted of a felony? A. No, sir. Q. Is there any additional work, documents, or notes, or anything in your project file that we didn't discuss our or you haven't produced today? A. No, sir. Not to my recollection. No. Q. Are there any other documents that we haven't discussed or you haven't produced that you relied on to prepare your estimates in this case? A. No, sir. MR. WHITLOCK: Okay. That's all I have. Thank you for your time. I really appreciate it. THE DEPONENT: Yeah. You bet. Thank you? MR. HAMILTON: I want to ask you a few questions, Mr. Cianchetti. THE DEPONENT: Okay. CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. HAMILTON: Q. This notion of an actual cash value, there's no -- If I understand your testimony, there's no right or wrong answer with regard to how much depreciation to apply to a particular item; two different estimators could come up with two different -- two different numbers for the depreciation value; is that fair? A. Absolutely -MR. WHITLOCK: Objection. A. -- that's correct. Q. However -- however, when you calculate depreciation you're not pulling a number out of thin air, are you? A. No, sir. No. I'm reviewing -Q. Just bear -A. -- I'm reviewing the photos. Q. -- just bear with me. Okay. Just listen to my question and answer my question. A. Okay. Q. You base a calculation of actual cash value on your observation of the item, the condition of the item, or a photographs representing the condition of the item, plus your experience, and your knowledge of how -- of -of the expected useful life of a particular item; is that correct? A. That's correct. Yes, sir. Q. You -- you mentioned that it's a guesstimate. And I -- I want to -- I want to challenge you on that. It's not a guesstimate. This is something that you give an opinion on based on your years of education, training and experience in this field; is it not? A. That's correct. Yes. Q. Okay. A. When I -Q. So. A. -- basically was saying is that you and I and everyone else on this panel would come up with a totally different thing. So based off their experiences and past experience. Q. Well, maybe they would, and maybe they wouldn't. But the point is, you're not randomly picking a number, you're -- you're -- you're basing it on facts upon which you come up with your depreciated value. A. That is correct. Yes, sir. Q. Okay. You -- there was -- I think there was some confusion about the notion of overhead and profit. You said that the Xactimate estimate has built into it some overhead and profit. A. That is correct. Yeah, it's just if -- the general contractor overhead and profit is the ten and ten which is added to everything. Q. That's what I want to ask you about. Okay? A. Okay. Q. That's what I want to ask you about. A. Okay. Q. Isn't it -- isn't it accepted in your and in your industry and in the insurance restoration industry that if a general contractor is gonna be required to coordinate the various tradespeople that there is ten percent overhead and ten percent profit charged on the whole job, correct? A. That's correct. Yes. Anything -Q. And that includes items like Dumpster rental, correct? A. That's correct. Yes. Q. Because that contractor has to coordinate that, right? A. That's correct. Q. That includes a bill for $15,000 from an electrical subcontractor to re-wire a structure, correct? A. That's correct. Yes. 'Cause they're subcontracting that out. Q. Exactly. So the -- the -- the overhead and profit is calculated on the -- the total amount of the job if you -- if it's -- if the job is such that it requires a general contractor with multiple trades, fair enough? A. That's correct. Yes. It's the complexity of the coordination is why they do that because it's a -- it's an undertaking to have multiple trades go out. You can't have them all out there at the same time; so that's where the coordination's coming in. Yes, sir. Q. Un -- Understood. And -- and in your experience is the -- the restoration of St. Michaels one that would require a general contractor? A. Oh, all day long. Yes, sir. Yeah. Absolutely. Q. Okay. Back to the issue of -- of depreciation. Depreciation is not applied to labor charges, for example, is it? A. No, sir. It's just to the material cost. Q. All right. You were asked about the -- the date of the photographs that you took were reflected as October 8th, 2019. And you said that that date was incorrect. Why is that date incorrect? A. Well, I'm trying to figure when I went out there, because I think I went out there on -- I thought it was on November, but I could be wrong. I thought I inspected on the 6th or something. Q. That's the date that your estimate was entered, but that's -- I mean, is that necessarily the date that you inspected it? A. Not necessarily. No. No. 'Cause I -- it depends on like when I entered the estimate could be at a later date; so that -- that's correct. So I really don't know the exact date I was out there, so... Q. Can we agree that it was -- it was within a month of the date that the estimate was prepared; can we agree on that? A. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Q. Okay. The only other thing -- and this could be a function of my poor hearing, but I thought that I heard you say that you -- you didn't know anything -- or that you only found out that this was a contested claim and you said, quote now. And -- and I want to clarify that. I mean, you -- you had an understanding that -that -- that lawyers were involved in this claim, you know, since you and I first talked about it, correct? A. Correct. That's what I mean. From the time of when we had actually spoke about it, that's when I knew that there was a litigation -- a potential litigation -Q. You meant several months ago when we first talked. A. That's right. Exactly. Yes. Sorry about that. MR. HAMILTON: That's all I needed to ask you Mr. Cianchetti.
