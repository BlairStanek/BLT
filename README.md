This contains all the code for our paper *BLT: Can Large Language Models Handle Basic Legal Text?*.  The code that calls the APIs, tests for accuracy (using hand-crafted rules), and classifies the errors is in the Call directory.  

The test and train sets for BLT-4k are in the Data directory of this repository.  BLT-4k and larger-prompt-window versions of the benchmark are available for download at the links below:
