The Secretary may approve a plan of action for extension of the low-income affordability restrictions on any eligible low-income housing or transfer the housing to a qualified purchaser (other than a resident council) only upon finding that\u2014\n  (1) due diligence has been given to ensuring that the package of incentives is, for the Federal Government, the least costly alternative that is consistent with the full achievement of the purposes of this title;\n  (2) binding commitments have been made to ensure that\u2014\n    (A) the housing will be retained as housing affordable for very low-income families or persons, low-income families or persons, and moderate-income families or persons for the remaining useful life of such housing (as determined under subsection (c));\n    (B) throughout such period, adequate expenditures will be made for maintenance and operation of the housing and that the project meets housing standards established by the Secretary under subsection (d), as determined by inspections conducted under such subsection by the Secretary;\n    (C) current tenants will not be involuntarily displaced (except for good cause);\n    (D) any increase in rent contributions for current tenants will be to a level that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under section 1437f(c) of title 42, whichever is lower, except that the rent contributions of any tenants occupying the housing at the time of any increase may not be reduced by reason of this subparagraph (except with respect to tenants receiving section 8 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437f] assistance in accordance with subparagraph (E)(ii) of this paragraph);\n    (E)\n      (i) any resulting increase in rents for current tenants (except for increases made necessary by increased operating costs)\u2014\n        (I) shall be phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and\n        (II) shall be limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent; and\n      (ii) assistance under section 1437f of title 42 shall be provided, to the extent available under appropriation Acts, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effect on current income-eligible very low- and low-income tenants; and\n    (F)\n      (i) rents for units becoming available to new tenants shall be at levels approved by the Secretary that will ensure, to the extent practicable, that the units will be available and affordable to the same proportions of very low-income families or persons, low-income families or persons, and moderate-income families or persons (including families or persons whose incomes are 95 percent or more of area median income) as resided in the housing as of January 1, 1987 (based on the area median income limits established by the Secretary in February 1987), or the date the plan of action is approved, whichever date results in the highest proportion of very low-income families, except that this limitation shall not prohibit a higher proportion of very low-income families from occupying the housing; and\n      (ii) in approving rents under this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into account any additional incentives provided under this subchapter;\n    (G) future rent adjustments shall be\u2014\n      (i) made by applying an annual factor (to be determined by the Secretary) to the portion of rent attributable to operating expenses for the housing and, where the owner is a priority purchaser, to the portion of rent attributable to project oversight costs; and\n      (ii) subject to a procedure, established by the Secretary, for owners to apply for rent increases not adequately compensated by annual adjustment under clause (i), under which the Secretary may increase rents in excess of the amount determined under clause (i) only if the Secretary determines such increases are necessary to reflect extraordinary necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the housing; and\n    (H) any savings from reductions in operating expenses due to management efficiencies shall be deposited in project reserves for replacement and the owner shall have periodic access to such reserves, to the extent the Secretary determines that the level of reserves is adequate and that the housing is maintained in accordance with the standards established under subsection (d); and\n  (3) no incentives under section 4109 of this title (other than to purchasers under section 4110 of this title) may be provided until the Secretary determines the project meets housing standards under subsection (d), except that incentives under such section and other incentives designed to correct deficiencies in the project may be provided.\n(b) Implementation. Any agreement to maintain the low-income affordability restrictions for the remaining useful life of the housing may be made through execution of a new regulatory agreement, modifications to the existing regulatory agreement or mortgage, or, in the case of the prepayment of a mortgage or voluntary termination of mortgage insurance, a recorded instrument.\n(c) Determination of remaining useful life.\n  (1) \u201cRemaining useful life\u201d defined. For purposes of this title,1 the term \u201cremaining useful life\u201d means, with respect to eligible low-income housing, the period during which the physical characteristics of the housing remain in a condition suitable for occupancy, assuming normal maintenance and repairs are made and major systems and capital components are replaced as becomes necessary.\n  (2) Standards. The Secretary shall, by rule under section 553 of title 5, establish standards for determining when the useful life of an eligible low-income housing project has expired. The determination shall be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing.\n  (3) Owner petition. The Secretary shall establish a procedure under which owners of eligible low-income housing may petition the Secretary for a determination that the useful life of such housing has expired. The procedure shall not permit such a petition before the expiration of the 50-year period beginning upon the approval of a plan of action under this subchapter with respect to such housing. In making a determination pursuant to a petition under this paragraph, the Secretary shall presume that the useful life of the housing has not expired, and the owner shall have the burden of proof in establishing such expiration. The Secretary may not determine that the useful life of any housing has expired if such determination results primarily from failure to make regular and reasonable repairs and replacement, as became necessary.\n  (4) Tenant and community comment and appeal. In making a determination regarding the useful life of any housing pursuant to a petition submitted under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall provide for comment by tenants of the housing and interested persons and organizations with respect to the petition. The Secretary shall also provide the tenants and interested persons and organizations with an opportunity to appeal a determination under this subsection.\n(d) Housing standards.\n  (1) Establishment and inspection. The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish standards regarding the physical condition in which any eligible low income housing project receiving incentives under this subchapter shall be maintained. The Secretary shall inspect each such project not less than annually to ensure that the project is in compliance with such standards.\n  (2) Sanctions.\n    (A) In general. The Secretary shall take any action appropriate to require the owner of any housing not in compliance with such standards to bring such housing into compliance with the standards, including\u2014\n      (i) directing the mortgagee, with respect to an equity take-out loan under section 1715z\u20136(f) 1 of this title, to withhold the disbursement to the owner of any escrowed loan proceeds and requiring that such proceeds be used for repair of the housing; and\n      (ii) reduce the amount of the annual authorized return, as determined by the Secretary, for the period ending upon a determination by the Secretary that the project is in compliance with the standards and requiring that such amounts be used for repair.\n    (B) Continued compliance. To ensure continued compliance with the standards for a project subject to any action under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may also limit access of the owner to such amounts and use of such amounts for not more than the 2-year period beginning upon the determination that the project is in compliance with the standards.\n    (C) Removal of assistance. If, upon inspection, the Secretary determines that any eligible low income housing project has failed to comply with the standards established under this subsection for 2 consecutive years, the Secretary may take 1 or more of the following actions:\n      (i) Subject to availability of amounts provided in appropriations Acts, provide assistance under sections 1437f(b) and 1437f(o) of title 42 (other than project-based assistance attached to the housing) for any tenant eligible for such assistance who desires to terminate occupancy in the housing. For each unit in the housing vacated pursuant to the provision of assistance under this clause, the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other law or contract for assistance, cancel the provision of project-based assistance attached to the housing for 1 dwelling unit, if the housing is receiving such assistance.\n      (ii) In the case of housing for which an equity take-out loan has been made under section 1715z\u20136(f) 1 of this title, declare such loan to be in default and accelerate the maturity date of the loan.\n      (iii) Declare any rehabilitation loan insured or provided by the Secretary (with respect to the housing) to be in default and accelerate the maturity date of the loan.\n      (iv) Suspend payments under or terminate any contract for project-based rental assistance under section 1437f of title 42.\n      (v) Take any other action authorized by law or the project regulatory agreement to ensure that the housing will be brought into compliance with the standards established under this subsection.\n(e) Distribution and residual receipts.\n  (1) Authority. After December 4, 2015, the owner of a property subject to a plan of action or use agreement pursuant to this section shall be entitled to distribute\u2014\n    (A) annually, all surplus cash generated by the property, but only if the owner is in material compliance with such use agreement including compliance with prevailing physical condition standards established by the Secretary; and\n    (B) notwithstanding any conflicting provision in such use agreement, any funds accumulated in a residual receipts account, but only if the owner is in material compliance with such use agreement and has completed, or set aside sufficient funds for completion of, any capital repairs identified by the most recent third party capital needs assessment.\n  (2) Operation of property. An owner that distributes any amounts pursuant to paragraph (1) shall\u2014\n    (A) continue to operate the property in accordance with the affordability provisions of the use agreement for the property for the remaining useful life of the property;\n    (B) as required by the plan of action for the property, continue to renew or extend any project-based rental assistance contract for a term of not less than 20 years; and\n    (C) if the owner has an existing multi-year project-based rental assistance contract for less than 20 years, have the option to extend the contract to a 20-year term.\n\nWhat is the term defined at section 4112(c)(1) above?", "idx_line": 23, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 4112", "line_text": "\u00a7 4112.

The Secretary may provide by regulations for the application of this paragraph at times other than the times provided in this paragraph.\n(b) Exceptions.\n  (1) In general. Subsection (a) shall not apply to\u2014\n    (A) any security held for investment,\n    (B)\n      (i) any security described in subsection (c)(2)(C) which is acquired (including originated) by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of a trade or business of the taxpayer and which is not held for sale, and (ii) any obligation to acquire a security described in clause (i) if such obligation is entered into in the ordinary course of such trade or business and is not held for sale, and\n    (C) any security which is a hedge with respect to\u2014\n      (i) a security to which subsection (a) does not apply, or\n      (ii) a position, right to income, or a liability which is not a security in the hands of the taxpayer.\n  To the extent provided in regulations, subparagraph (C) shall not apply to any security held by a person in its capacity as a dealer in securities.\n  (2) Identification required. A security shall not be treated as described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1), as the case may be, unless such security is clearly identified in the dealer\u2019s records as being described in such subparagraph before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into (or such other time as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe).\n  (3) Securities subsequently not exempt. If a security ceases to be described in paragraph (1) at any time after it was identified as such under paragraph (2), subsection (a) shall apply to any changes in value of the security occurring after the cessation.\n  (4) Special rule for property held for investment. To the extent provided in regulations, subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) shall not apply to any security described in subparagraph (D) or (E) of subsection (c)(2) which is held by a dealer in such securities.\n(c) Definitions. For purposes of this section\u2014\n  (1) Dealer in securities defined. The term \u201cdealer in securities\u201d means a taxpayer who\u2014\n    (A) regularly purchases securities from or sells securities to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business; or\n    (B) regularly offers to enter into, assume, offset, assign or otherwise terminate positions in securities with customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.\n  (2) Security defined. The term \u201csecurity\u201d means any\u2014\n    (A) share of stock in a corporation;\n    (B) partnership or beneficial ownership interest in a widely held or publicly traded partnership or trust;\n    (C) note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness;\n    (D) interest rate, currency, or equity notional principal contract;\n    (E) evidence of an interest in, or a derivative financial instrument in, any security described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D), or any currency, including any option, forward contract, short position, and any similar financial instrument in such a security or currency; and\n    (F) position which\u2014\n      (i) is not a security described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E),\n      (ii) is a hedge with respect to such a security, and\n      (iii) is clearly identified in the dealer\u2019s records as being described in this subparagraph before the close of the day on which it was acquired or entered into (or such other time as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe).\n  Subparagraph (E) shall not include any contract to which section 1256(a) applies.\n  (3) Hedge. The term \u201chedge\u201d means any position which manages the dealer\u2019s risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations, including any position which is reasonably expected to become a hedge within 60 days after the acquisition of the position.\n  (4) Special rules for certain receivables.\n    (A) In general.

For purposes of this section\u2014\n  (1) Coordination with certain rules. The rules of sections 263(g), 263A, and 1256(a) shall not apply to securities to which subsection (a) applies, and section 1091 shall not apply (and section 1092 shall apply) to any loss recognized under subsection (a).\n  (2) Improper identification. If a taxpayer\u2014\n    (A) identifies any security under subsection (b)(2) as being described in subsection (b)(1) and such security is not so described, or\n    (B) fails under subsection (c)(2)(F)(iii) to identify any position which is described in subsection (c)(2)(F) (without regard to clause (iii) thereof) at the time such identification is required,\n  the provisions of subsection (a) shall apply to such security or position, except that any loss under this section prior to the disposition of the security or position shall be recognized only to the extent of gain previously recognized under this section (and not previously taken into account under this paragraph) with respect to such security or position.\n  (3) Character of gain or loss.\n    (A) In general.

If\u2014\n        (I) gain or loss is recognized with respect to a security before the close of the taxable year, and\n        (II) subsection (a)(2) would have applied if the security were held as of the close of the taxable year,\n    \u2001such gain or loss shall be treated as ordinary income or loss.\n    (B) Exception. Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any gain or loss which is allocable to a period during which\u2014\n      (i) the security is described in subsection (b)(1)(C) (without regard to subsection (b)(2)),\n      (ii) the security is held by a person other than in connection with its activities as a dealer in securities, or\n      (iii) the security is improperly identified (within the meaning of subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2)).\n(e) Election of mark to market for dealers in commodities.\n  (1) In general. In the case of a dealer in commodities who elects the application of this subsection, this section shall apply to commodities held by such dealer in the same manner as this section applies to securities held by a dealer in securities.\n  (2) Commodity.

An election under this subsection may be made without the consent of the Secretary. Such an election, once made, shall apply to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary.\n(f) Election of mark to market for traders in securities or commodities.\n  (1) Traders in securities.\n    (A) In general. In the case of a person who is engaged in a trade or business as a trader in securities and who elects to have this paragraph apply to such trade or business\u2014\n      (i) such person shall recognize gain or loss on any security held in connection with such trade or business at the close of any taxable year as if such security were sold for its fair market value on the last business day of such taxable year, and\n      (ii) any gain or loss shall be taken into account for such taxable year.\n    Proper adjustment shall be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain or loss taken into account under the preceding sentence. The Secretary may provide by regulations for the application of this subparagraph at times other than the times provided in this subparagraph.\n    (B) Exception. Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any security\u2014\n      (i) which is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary as having no connection to the activities of such person as a trader, and\n      (ii) which is clearly identified in such person\u2019s records as being described in clause (i) before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into (or such other time as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe).\n    If a security ceases to be described in clause (i) at any time after it was identified as such under clause (ii), subparagraph (A) shall apply to any changes in value of the security occurring after the cessation.\n    (C) Coordination with section 1259. Any security to which subparagraph (A) applies and which was acquired in the normal course of the taxpayer\u2019s activities as a trader in securities shall not be taken into account in applying section 1259 to any position to which subparagraph (A) does not apply.\n    (D) Other rules to apply. Rules similar to the rules of subsections (b)(4) and (d) shall apply to securities held by a person in any trade or business with respect to which an election under this paragraph is in effect. Subsection (d)(3) shall not apply under the preceding sentence for purposes of applying sections 1402 and 7704.\n  (2) Traders in commodities. In the case of a person who is engaged in a trade or business as a trader in commodities and who elects to have this paragraph apply to such trade or business, paragraph (1) shall apply to commodities held by such trader in connection with such trade or business in the same manner as paragraph (1) applies to securities held by a trader in securities.\n  (3) Election. The elections under paragraphs (1) and (2) may be made separately for each trade or business and without the consent of the Secretary. Such an election, once made, shall apply to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary.\n(g) Regulatory authority. The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section, including rules\u2014\n  (1) to prevent the use of year-end transfers, related parties, or other arrangements to avoid the provisions of this section,\n  (2) to provide for the application of this section to any security which is a hedge which cannot be identified with a specific security, position, right to income, or liability, and\n  (3) to prevent the use by taxpayers of subsection (c)(4) to avoid the application of this section to a receivable that is inventory in the hands of the taxpayer (or a person who bears a relationship to the taxpayer described in section 267(b) or 707(b)).\n\nWhat is the term defined at section 475(c)(2) above?", "idx_line": 23, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 475", "line_text": "\u00a7 475.

If a corporation has a net capital loss for any taxable year (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the \u201closs year\u201d), the amount thereof shall be\u2014\n    (A) a capital loss carryback to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year, but only to the extent\u2014\n      (i) such loss is not attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss, and\n      (ii) the carryback of such loss does not increase or produce a net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for the taxable year to which it is being carried back;\n    (B) except as provided in subparagraph (C), a capital loss carryover to each of the 5 taxable years succeeding the loss year; and\n    (C) a capital loss carryover to each of the 10 taxable years succeeding the loss year, but only to the extent such loss is attributable to a foreign expropriation loss,\n  and shall be treated as a short-term capital loss in each such taxable year. The entire amount of the net capital loss for any taxable year shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which such loss may be carried, and the portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years to which such loss may be carried shall be the excess, if any, of such loss over the total of the capital gain net income for each of the prior taxable years to which such loss may be carried. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the capital gain net income for any such prior taxable year shall be computed without regard to the net capital loss for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter. In the case of any net capital loss which cannot be carried back in full to a preceding taxable year by reason of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), the capital gain net income for such prior taxable year shall in no case be treated as greater than the amount of such loss which can be carried back to such preceding taxable year upon the application of such clause (ii).\n  (2) Definitions and special rules.\n    (A) Foreign expropriation capital loss defined. For purposes of this subsection, the term \u201cforeign expropriation capital loss\u201d means, for any taxable year, the sum of the losses taken into account in computing the net capital loss for such year which are\u2014\n      (i) losses sustained directly by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of property by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing, or\n      (ii) losses (treated under section 165(g)(1) as losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets) from securities which become worthless by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of property by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing.\n    (B) Portion of loss attributable to foreign expropriation capital loss. For purposes of paragraph (1), the portion of any net capital loss for any taxable year attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss is the amount of the foreign expropriation capital loss for such year (but not in excess of the net capital loss for such year).\n    (C) Priority of application. For purposes of paragraph (1), if a portion of a net capital loss for any taxable year is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss, such portion shall be considered to be a separate net capital loss for such year to be applied after the other portion of such net capital loss.\n  (3) Regulated investment companies.\n    (A) In general. If a regulated investment company has a net capital loss for any taxable year\u2014\n      (i) paragraph (1) shall not apply to such loss,\n      (ii) the excess of the net short-term capital loss over the net long-term capital gain for such year shall be a short-term capital loss arising on the first day of the next taxable year, and\n      (iii) the excess of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain for such year shall be a long-term capital loss arising on the first day of the next taxable year.\n    (B) Coordination with general rule. If a net capital loss to which paragraph (1) applies is carried over to a taxable year of a regulated investment company\u2014\n      (i) Losses to which this paragraph applies. Clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) shall be applied without regard to any amount treated as a short-term capital loss under paragraph (1).\n      (ii) Losses to which general rule applies. Paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting \u201cnet capital loss for the loss year or any taxable year thereafter (other than a net capital loss to which paragraph (3)(A) applies)\u201d for \u201cnet capital loss for the loss year or any taxable year thereafter\u201d.\n  (4) Special rules on carrybacks. A net capital loss of a corporation shall not be carried back under paragraph (1)(A) to a taxable year\u2014\n    (A) for which it is a regulated investment company (as defined in section 851), or\n    (B) for which it is a real estate investment trust (as defined in section 856).\n(b) Other taxpayers.\n  (1) In general. If a taxpayer other than a corporation has a net capital loss for any taxable year\u2014\n    (A) the excess of the net short-term capital loss over the net long-term capital gain for such year shall be a short-term capital loss in the succeeding taxable year, and\n    (B) the excess of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain for such year shall be a long-term capital loss in the succeeding taxable year.\n  (2) Treatment of amounts allowed under section 1211(b)(1) or (2).\n    (A) In general. For purposes of determining the excess referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), there shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in the taxable year an amount equal to the lesser of\u2014\n      (i) the amount allowed for the taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1211(b), or\n      (ii) the adjusted taxable income for such taxable year.\n    (B) Adjusted taxable income. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term \u201cadjusted taxable income\u201d means taxable income increased by the sum of\u2014\n      (i) the amount allowed for the taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1211(b), and\n      (ii) the deduction allowed for such year under section 151 or any deduction in lieu thereof.\n    For purposes of the preceding sentence, any excess of the deductions allowed for the taxable year over the gross income for such year shall be taken into account as negative taxable income.\n(c) Carryback of losses from section 1256 contracts to offset prior gains from such contracts.\n  (1) In general. If a taxpayer (other than a corporation) has a net section 1256 contracts loss for the taxable year and elects to have this subsection apply to such taxable year, the amount of such net section 1256 contracts loss\u2014\n    (A) shall be a carryback to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year, and\n    (B) to the extent that, after the application of paragraphs (2) and (3), such loss is allowed as a carryback to any such preceding taxable year\u2014\n      (i) 40 percent of the amount so allowed shall be treated as a short-term capital loss from section 1256 contracts, and\n      (ii) 60 percent of the amount so allowed shall be treated as a long-term capital loss from section 1256 contracts.\n  (2) Amount carried to each taxable year. The entire amount of the net section 1256 contracts loss for any taxable year shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which such loss may be carried back under paragraph (1). The portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the 2 other taxable years to which such loss may be carried back shall be the excess (if any) of such loss over the portion of such loss which, after the application of paragraph (3), was allowed as a carryback for any prior taxable year.\n  (3) Amount which may be used in any prior taxable year. An amount shall be allowed as a carryback under paragraph (1) to any prior taxable year only to the extent\u2014\n    (A) such amount does not exceed the net section 1256 contract gain for such year, and\n    (B) the allowance of such carryback does not increase or produce a net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for such year.\n  (4) Net section 1256 contracts loss. For purposes of paragraph (1), the term \u201cnet section 1256 contracts loss\u201d means the lesser of\u2014\n    (A) the net capital loss for the taxable year determined by taking into account only gains and losses from section 1256 contracts, or\n    (B) the sum of the amounts which, but for paragraph (6)(A), would be treated as capital losses in the succeeding taxable year under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (b)(1).\n  (5) Net section 1256 contract gain. For purposes of paragraph (1)\u2014\n    (A) In general. The term \u201cnet section 1256 contract gain\u201d means the lesser of\u2014\n      (i) the capital gain net income for the taxable year determined by taking into account only gains and losses from section 1256 contracts, or\n      (ii) the capital gain net income for the taxable year.\n    (B) Special rule. The net section 1256 contract gain for any taxable year before the loss year shall be computed without regard to the net section 1256 contracts loss for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter.\n  (6) Coordination with carryforward provisions of subsection (b)(1).\n    (A) Carryforward amount reduced by amount used as carryback. For purposes of applying subsection (b)(1), if any portion of the net section 1256 contracts loss for any taxable year is allowed as a carryback under paragraph (1) to any preceding taxable year\u2014\n      (i) 40 percent of the amount allowed as a carryback shall be treated as a short-term capital gain for the loss year, and\n      (ii) 60 percent of the amount allowed as a carryback shall be treated as a long-term capital gain for the loss year.\n    (B) Carryover loss retains character as attributable to section 1256 contract. Any amount carried forward as a short-term or long-term capital loss to any taxable year under subsection (b)(1) (after the application of subparagraph (A)) shall, to the extent attributable to losses from section 1256 contracts, be treated as loss from section 1256 contracts for such taxable year.\n  (7) Other definitions and special rules. For purposes of this subsection\u2014\n    (A) Section 1256 contract. The term \u201csection 1256 contract\u201d means any section 1256 contract (as defined in section 1256(b)) to which section 1256 applies.\n    (B) Exclusion for estates and trusts.

The President, subject to subsection (c), shall apply sanctions under subsection (b) for a period of not less than 2 years and not more than 5 years, if the President determines that\u2014\n  (1) a foreign person has violated any regulation issued by a country to control exports for national security purposes pursuant to the agreement of the group known as the Coordinating Committee, and\n  (2) such violation has resulted in substantial enhancement of Soviet and East bloc capabilities in submarine or antisubmarine warfare, ballistic or antiballistic missile technology, strategic aircraft, command, control, communications and intelligence, or other critical technologies as determined by the President, on the advice of the National Security Council, to represent a serious adverse impact on the strategic balance of forces.\nThe President shall notify the Congress of each action taken under this section. This section, except subsections (h) and (j), applies only to violations that occur after August 23, 1988.\n(b) Sanctions. The sanctions referred to in subsection (a) shall apply to the foreign person committing the violation, as well as to any parent, affiliate, subsidiary, and successor entity of the foreign person, and, except as provided in subsection (c), are as follows:\n  (1) a prohibition on contracting with, and procurement of products and services from, a sanctioned person, by any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government, and\n  (2) a prohibition on importation into the United States of all products produced by a sanctioned person.\n(c) Exceptions. The President shall not apply sanctions under this section\u2014\n  (1) in the case of procurement of defense articles or defense services\u2014\n    (A) under existing contracts or subcontracts, including the exercise of options for production quantities to satisfy United States operational military requirements;\n    (B) if the President determines that the foreign person or other entity to which the sanctions would otherwise be applied is a sole source supplier of essential defense articles or services and no alternative supplier can be identified; or\n    (C) if the President determines that such articles or services are essential to the national security under defense coproduction agreements; or\n  (2) to\u2014\n    (A) products or services provided under contracts or other binding agreements (as such terms are defined by the President in regulations) entered into before the date on which the President notifies the Congress of the intention to impose the sanctions;\n    (B) spare parts;\n    (C) component parts, but not finished products, essential to United States products or production;\n    (D) routine servicing and maintenance of products; or\n    (E) information and technology.\n(d) Exclusion. The President shall not apply sanctions under this section to a parent, affiliate, subsidiary, and successor entity of a foreign person if the President determines that\u2014\n  (1) the parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity (as the case may be) has not knowingly violated the export control regulation violated by the foreign person, and\n  (2) the government of the country with jurisdiction over the parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity had in effect, at the time of the violation by the foreign person, an effective export control system consistent with principles agreed to in the Coordinating Committee, including the following:\n    (A) national laws providing appropriate civil and criminal penalties and statutes of limitations sufficient to deter potential violations;\n    (B) a program to evaluate export license applications that includes sufficient technical expertise to assess the licensing status of exports and ensure the reliability of end-users;\n    (C) an enforcement mechanism that provides authority for trained enforcement officers to investigate and prevent illegal exports;\n    (D) a system of export control documentation to verify the movement of goods and technology; and\n    (E) procedures for the coordination and exchange of information concerning violations of the agreement of the Coordinating Committee.\n(e) Definitions. For purposes of this section\u2014\n  (1) the term \u201ccomponent part\u201d means any article which is not usable for its intended functions without being imbedded in or integrated into any other product and which, if used in production of a finished product, would be substantially transformed in that process;\n  (2) the term \u201cfinished product\u201d means any article which is usable for its intended functions without being imbedded or integrated into any other product, but in no case shall such term be deemed to include an article produced by a person other than a sanctioned person that contains parts or components of the sanctioned person if the parts or components have been substantially transformed during production of the finished product; and\n  (3) the term \u201csanctioned person\u201d means a foreign person, and any parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity of the foreign person, upon whom sanctions have been imposed under this section.\n(f) Subsequent modifications of sanctions. The President may, after consultation with the Congress, limit the scope of sanctions applied to a parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity of the foreign person determined to have committed the violation on account of which the sanctions were imposed if the President determines that\u2014\n  (1) the parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity (as the case may be) has not, on the basis of available evidence, itself violated the export control regulation involved, either directly or through a course of conduct;\n  (2) the government with jurisdiction over the parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity has improved its export control system as measured by the criteria set forth in subsection (d)(2);\n  (3) the parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity, has instituted improvements in internal controls sufficient to detect and prevent violations of the export control regime implemented under paragraph (2); and\n  (4) the impact of the sanctions imposed on the parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity is proportionate to the increased defense expenditures imposed on the United States.\nNotwithstanding the preceding sentence, the President may not limit the scope of the sanction referred to in subsection (b)(1) with respect to the parent of the foreign person determined to have committed the violation, until that sanction has been in effect for at least 2 years.\n(g) Reports to Congress. The President shall include in the annual report submitted under section 4616 of this title, a report on the status of any sanctions imposed under this section, including any exceptions, exclusions, or modifications of sanctions that have been applied under subsection (c), (d), or (f).\n(h) Discretionary imposition of sanctions. If the President determines that a foreign person has violated a regulation issued by a country to control exports for national security purposes pursuant to the agreement of the group known as the Coordinating Committee, but in a case in which subsection (a)(2) may not apply, the President may apply the sanctions referred to in subsection (b) against that foreign person for a period of not more than 5 years.\n(i) Compensation for diversion of militarily critical technologies to controlled countries.\n  (1) In cases in which sanctions have been applied against a foreign person under subsection (a), the President shall initiate discussions with the foreign person and the government with jurisdiction over that foreign person regarding compensation on the part of the foreign person in an amount proportionate to the costs of research and development and procurement of new defensive systems by the United States and the allies of the United States to counteract the effect of the technological advance achieved by the Soviet Union as a result of the violation by that foreign person.\n  (2) The President shall, at the time that discussions are initiated under paragraph (1), report to the Congress that such discussions are being undertaken, and shall report to the Congress the outcome of those discussions.\n(j) Other actions by the President. Upon making a determination under subsection (a) or (h), the President shall\u2014\n  (1) initiate consultations with the foreign government with jurisdiction over the foreign person who committed the violation involved, in order to seek prompt remedial action by that government;\n  (2) initiate discussions with the governments participating in the Coordinating Committee regarding the violation and means to ensure that similar violations do not occur; and\n  (3) consult with and report to the Congress on the nature of the violation and the actions the President proposes to take, or has taken, to rectify the situation.\n(k) Damages for certain violations.\n  (1) In any case in which the President makes a determination under subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall determine the costs of restoring the military preparedness of the United States on account of the violation involved. The Secretary of Defense shall notify the Attorney General of his determination, and the Attorney General may bring an action for damages, in any appropriate district court of the United States, to recover such costs against the person who committed the violation, any person that is owned or controlled by the person who committed the violation, and any person who owns and controls the person who committed the violation.\n  (3) The total amount awarded in any case brought under paragraph (2) shall be determined by the court in light of the facts and circumstances, but shall not exceed the amount of the net loss to the national security of the United States. An action under this subsection shall be commenced not later than 3 years after the violation occurs, or one year after the violation is discovered, whichever is later.\n(l) Definition.

No State law which prohibits or regulates the making or promoting of wagering or gaming contracts, or the operation of \u201cbucket shops\u201d or other similar or related activities, shall invalidate\u2014\n    (A) any put, call, straddle, option, privilege, or other security subject to this chapter (except any security that has a pari-mutuel payout or otherwise is determined by the Commission, acting by rule, regulation, or order, to be appropriately subject to such laws), or apply to any activity which is incidental or related to the offer, purchase, sale, exercise, settlement, or closeout of any such security;\n    (B) any security-based swap between eligible contract participants; or\n    (C) any security-based swap effected on a national securities exchange registered pursuant to section 78f(b) of this title.\n  (4) Other State provisions.

The stay, setting aside, or modification pursuant to section 78s(e) of this title of any disciplinary sanction imposed by a self-regulatory organization on a member thereof, person associated with a member, or participant therein, shall not affect the validity or force of any action taken as a result of such sanction by the self-regulatory organization prior to such stay, setting aside, or modification: Provided, That such action is not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter or the rules or regulations thereunder. The rights of any person acting in good faith which arise out of any such action shall not be affected in any way by such stay, setting aside, or modification.\n(d) Physical location of facilities of registered clearing agencies or registered transfer agents not to subject changes in beneficial or record ownership of securities to State or local taxes.

No State or political subdivision thereof shall impose any tax on securities which are deposited in or retained by a registered clearing agency, registered transfer agent, or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor, unless such securities would otherwise be taxable by such State or political subdivision if the facilities of such registered clearing agency, registered transfer agent, or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor were not physically located in the taxing State or political subdivision.\n(e) Exchange, broker, and dealer commissions; brokerage and research services.\n  (1) No person using the mails, or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, in the exercise of investment discretion with respect to an account shall be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached a fiduciary duty under State or Federal law unless expressly provided to the contrary by a law enacted by the Congress or any State subsequent to June 4, 1975, solely by reason of his having caused the account to pay a member of an exchange, broker, or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission another member of an exchange, broker, or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if such person determined in good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such member, broker, or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or his overall responsibilities with respect to the accounts as to which he exercises investment discretion. This subsection is exclusive and plenary insofar as conduct is covered by the foregoing, unless otherwise expressly provided by contract: Provided, however, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair or limit the power of the Commission under any other provision of this chapter or otherwise.\n  (2) A person exercising investment discretion with respect to an account shall make such disclosure of his policies and practices with respect to commissions that will be paid for effecting securities transactions, at such times and in such manner, as the appropriate regulatory agency, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\n  (3) For purposes of this subsection a person provides brokerage and research services insofar as he\u2014\n    (A) furnishes advice, either directly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities, the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities, and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities;\n    (B) furnishes analyses and reports concerning issuers, industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy, and the performance of accounts; or\n    (C) effects securities transactions and performs functions incidental thereto (such as clearance, settlement, and custody) or required in connection therewith by rules of the Commission or a self-regulatory organization of which such person is a member or person associated with a member or in which such person is a participant.\n  (4) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply with regard to securities that are security futures products.\n(f) Limitations on remedies.\n  (1) Class action limitations. No covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any State or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any State or Federal court by any private party alleging\u2014\n    (A) a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security; or\n    (B) that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\n  (2) Removal of covered class actions. Any covered class action brought in any State court involving a covered security, as set forth in paragraph (1), shall be removable to the Federal district court for the district in which the action is pending, and shall be subject to paragraph (1).\n  (3) Preservation of certain actions.\n    (A) Actions under State law of State of incorporation.\n      (i) Actions preserved. Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2), a covered class action described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph that is based upon the statutory or common law of the State in which the issuer is incorporated (in the case of a corporation) or organized (in the case of any other entity) may be maintained in a State or Federal court by a private party.\n      (ii) Permissible actions. A covered class action is described in this clause if it involves\u2014\n        (I) the purchase or sale of securities by the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer exclusively from or to holders of equity securities of the issuer; or\n        (II) any recommendation, position, or other communication with respect to the sale of securities of an issuer that\u2014\n          (aa) is made by or on behalf of the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer to holders of equity securities of the issuer; and\n          (bb) concerns decisions of such equity holders with respect to voting their securities, acting in response to a tender or exchange offer, or exercising dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights.\n    (B) State actions.\n      (i) In general. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, nothing in this subsection may be construed to preclude a State or political subdivision thereof or a State pension plan from bringing an action involving a covered security on its own behalf, or as a member of a class comprised solely of other States, political subdivisions, or State pension plans that are named plaintiffs, and that have authorized participation, in such action.\n      (ii) State pension plan defined. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term \u201cState pension plan\u201d means a pension plan established and maintained for its employees by the government of a State or political subdivision thereof, or by any agency or instrumentality thereof.\n    (C) Actions under contractual agreements between issuers and indenture trustees. Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2), a covered class action that seeks to enforce a contractual agreement between an issuer and an indenture trustee may be maintained in a State or Federal court by a party to the agreement or a successor to such party.\n    (D) Remand of removed actions. In an action that has been removed from a State court pursuant to paragraph (2), if the Federal court determines that the action may be maintained in State court pursuant to this subsection, the Federal court shall remand such action to such State court.\n  (4) Preservation of State jurisdiction. The securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of any State shall retain jurisdiction under the laws of such State to investigate and bring enforcement actions.\n  (5) Definitions. For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions shall apply:\n    (A) Affiliate of the issuer. The term \u201caffiliate of the issuer\u201d means a person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by or is under common control with, the issuer.\n    (B) Covered class action. The term \u201ccovered class action\u201d means\u2014\n      (i) any single lawsuit in which\u2014\n        (I) damages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons or prospective class members, and questions of law or fact common to those persons or members of the prospective class, without reference to issues of individualized reliance on an alleged misstatement or omission, predominate over any questions affecting only individual persons or members; or\n        (II) one or more named parties seek to recover damages on a representative basis on behalf of themselves and other unnamed parties similarly situated, and questions of law or fact common to those persons or members of the prospective class predominate over any questions affecting only individual persons or members; or\n      (ii) any group of lawsuits filed in or pending in the same court and involving common questions of law or fact, in which\u2014\n        (I) damages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons; and\n        (II) the lawsuits are joined, consolidated, or otherwise proceed as a single action for any purpose.\n    (C) Exception for derivative actions. Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the term \u201ccovered class action\u201d does not include an exclusively derivative action brought by one or more shareholders on behalf of a corporation.\n    (D) Counting of certain class members. For purposes of this paragraph, a corporation, investment company, pension plan, partnership, or other entity, shall be treated as one person or prospective class member, but only if the entity is not established for the purpose of participating in the action.\n    (E) Covered security. The term \u201ccovered security\u201d means a security that satisfies the standards for a covered security specified in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 18(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77r(b)], at the time during which it is alleged that the misrepresentation, omission, or manipulative or deceptive conduct occurred, except that such term shall not include any debt security that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 [ 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.] pursuant to rules issued by the Commission under section 4(2) of that Act [ 15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(2)].\n    (F) Rule of construction. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect the discretion of a State court in determining whether actions filed in such court should be joined, consolidated, or otherwise allowed to proceed as a single action.\n\nWhat is the term defined at section 78bb(f)(5)(B) above?", "idx_line": 41, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 78bb", "line_text": "\u00a7 78bb.

The cargo information required by the regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1) under the parameters set forth in paragraph (3) shall be such information on cargo as the Secretary determines to be reasonably necessary to ensure cargo safety and security pursuant to those laws enforced and administered by the Customs Service. The Secretary shall provide to appropriate Federal departments and agencies cargo information obtained pursuant to paragraph (1).\n  (3) Parameters. In developing regulations pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall adhere to the following parameters:\n    (A) The Secretary shall solicit comments from and consult with a broad range of parties likely to be affected by the regulations, including importers, exporters, carriers, customs brokers, and freight forwarders, among other interested parties.\n    (B) In general, the requirement to provide particular information shall be imposed on the party most likely to have direct knowledge of that information. Where requiring information from the party with direct knowledge of that information is not practicable, the regulations shall take into account how, under ordinary commercial practices, information is acquired by the party on which the requirement is imposed, and whether and how such party is able to verify the information. Where information is not reasonably verifiable by the party on which a requirement is imposed, the regulations shall permit that party to transmit information on the basis of what it reasonably believes to be true.\n    (C) The Secretary shall take into account the existence of competitive relationships among the parties on which requirements to provide particular information are imposed.\n    (D) Where the regulations impose requirements on carriers of cargo, they shall take into account differences among different modes of transportation, including differences in commercial practices, operational characteristics, and technological capacity to collect and transmit information electronically.\n    (E) The regulations shall take into account the extent to which the technology necessary for parties to transmit and the Customs Service to receive and analyze data in a timely fashion is available. To the extent that the Secretary determines that the necessary technology will not be widely available to particular modes of transportation or other affected parties until after promulgation of the regulations, the regulations shall provide interim requirements appropriate for the technology that is available at the time of promulgation.\n    (F) The information collected pursuant to the regulations shall be used exclusively for ensuring cargo safety and security, preventing smuggling, and commercial risk assessment targeting, and shall not be used for any commercial enforcement purposes, including for determining merchandise entry. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this section shall be treated as amending, repealing, or otherwise modifying title IV of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.] or regulations promulgated thereunder.\n    (G) The regulations shall protect the privacy of business proprietary and any other confidential cargo information provided to the Customs Service pursuant to such regulations, except for the manifest information collected pursuant to section 431 of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1431] and required to be available for public disclosure pursuant to section 431(c) of such Act..\n    (H) In determining the timing for transmittal of any information, the Secretary shall balance likely impact on flow of commerce with impact on cargo safety and security. With respect to requirements that may be imposed on carriers of cargo, the timing for transmittal of information shall take into account differences among different modes of transportation, as described in subparagraph (D).\n    (I) Where practicable, the regulations shall avoid imposing requirements that are redundant with one another or that are redundant with requirements in other provisions of law.\n    (J) The Secretary shall determine whether it is appropriate to provide transition periods between promulgation of the regulations and the effective date of the regulations and shall prescribe such transition periods in the regulations, as appropriate. The Secretary may determine that different transition periods are appropriate for different classes of affected parties.\n    (K)\n      (i) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring the United States Postal Service to transmit the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) to the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection for international mail shipments by the Postal Service (including shipments to the Postal Service from foreign postal operators that are transported by private carrier) consistent with the requirements of this subparagraph.\n      (ii) In prescribing regulations under clause (i), the Secretary shall impose requirements for the transmission to the Commissioner of information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) for mail shipments described in clause (i) that are comparable to the requirements for the transmission of such information imposed on similar non-mail shipments of cargo, taking into account the parameters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (J).\n      (iii) The regulations prescribed under clause (i) shall require the transmission of the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with respect to a shipment as soon as practicable in relation to the transportation of the shipment, consistent with subparagraph (H).\n      (iv) Regulations prescribed under clause (i) shall allow for the requirements for the transmission to the Commissioner of information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) for mail shipments described in clause (i) to be implemented in phases, as appropriate, by\u2014\n        (I) setting incremental targets for increasing the percentage of such shipments for which information is required to be transmitted to the Commissioner; and\n        (II) taking into consideration\u2014\n          (aa) the risk posed by such shipments;\n          (bb) the volume of mail shipped to the United States by or through a particular country; and\n          (cc) the capacities of foreign postal operators to provide that information to the Postal Service.\n      (v)\n        (I) Notwithstanding clause (iv), the Postal Service shall, not later than December 31, 2018, arrange for the transmission to the Commissioner of the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) for not less than 70 percent of the aggregate number of mail shipments, including 100 percent of mail shipments from the People\u2019s Republic of China, described in clause (i).\n        (II) If the requirements of subclause (I) are not met, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees, not later than June 30, 2019, a report\u2014\n          (aa) assessing the reasons for the failure to meet those requirements; and\n          (bb) identifying recommendations to improve the collection by the Postal Service of the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2).\n      (vi)\n        (I) Notwithstanding clause (iv), the Postal Service shall, not later than December 31, 2020, arrange for the transmission to the Commissioner of the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) for 100 percent of the aggregate number of mail shipments described in clause (i).\n        (II) The Commissioner, in consultation with the Postmaster General, may determine to exclude a country from the requirement described in subclause (I) to transmit information for mail shipments described in clause (i) from the country if the Commissioner determines that the country\u2014\n          (aa) does not have the capacity to collect and transmit such information;\n          (bb) represents a low risk for mail shipments that violate relevant United States laws and regulations; and\n          (cc) accounts for low volumes of mail shipments that can be effectively screened for compliance with relevant United States laws and regulations through an alternate means.\n        (III) The Commissioner shall, at a minimum on an annual basis, re-evaluate any determination made under subclause (II) to exclude a country from the requirement described in subclause (I). If, at any time, the Commissioner determines that a country no longer meets the requirements under subclause (II), the Commissioner may not further exclude the country from the requirement described in subclause (I).\n        (IV) The Commissioner shall, on an annual basis, submit to the appropriate congressional committees\u2014\n          (aa) a list of countries with respect to which the Commissioner has made a determination under subclause (II) to exclude the countries from the requirement described in subclause (I); and\n          (bb) information used to support such determination with respect to such countries.\n      (vii)\n        (I) The Postmaster General shall, in consultation with the Commissioner, refuse any shipments received after December 31, 2020, for which the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) is not transmitted as required under this subparagraph, except as provided in subclause (II) or (III).\n        (II) If remedial action is warranted in lieu of refusal of shipments pursuant to subclause (I), the Postmaster General and the Commissioner shall take remedial action with respect to the shipments, including destruction, seizure, controlled delivery or other law enforcement initiatives, or correction of the failure to provide the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with respect to the shipments.\n        (III) Notwithstanding subclause (I), during the period beginning on January 1, 2021, through March 15, 2021, the Postmaster General may accept a shipment without transmission of the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) if the Commissioner determines, or concurs with the determination of the Postmaster General, that the shipment presents a low risk of violating any relevant United States statutes or regulations, including statutes or regulations relating to the importation of controlled substances such as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.\n      (viii) Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to obtain information relating to international mail shipments from private carriers or other appropriate parties.\n      (ix) In this subparagraph, the term \u201cappropriate congressional committees\u201d means\u2014\n        (I) the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate; and\n        (II) the Committee on Ways and Means, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives.\n    (L) Not later than 15 days prior to publication of a final rule pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall transmit to the Committees on Finance and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committees on Ways and Means and Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report setting forth\u2014\n      (i) the proposed regulations;\n      (ii) an explanation of how particular requirements in the proposed regulations meet the needs of cargo safety and security;\n      (iii) an explanation of how the Secretary expects the proposed regulations to affect the commercial practices of affected parties;\n      (iv) an explanation of how the proposed regulations address particular comments received from interested parties; and\n      (v) if the Secretary determines to amend the proposed regulations after they have been transmitted to the Committees pursuant to this subparagraph, the Secretary shall transmit the amended regulations to such Committees no later than 5 days prior to the publication of the final rule.\n  (4) Transmission of data. Pursuant to paragraph (2), not later than 1 year after August 10, 2005, the Secretary of Homeland Security, after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall establish an electronic data interchange system through which the United States Customs and Border Protection shall transmit to the Internal Revenue Service information pertaining to cargoes of any taxable fuel (as defined in section 4083 of title 26) that the United States Customs and Border Protection has obtained electronically under its regulations adopted in accordance with paragraph (1). For this purpose, not later than 1 year after August 10, 2005, all filers of required cargo information for such taxable fuels (as so defined) must provide such information to the United States Customs and Border Protection through such electronic data interchange system.\n  (5) Capacity building.\n    (A) In general.

The Secretary shall report in the 1979 and subsequent Assessments on:\n  (1) the additional fiber potential in the National Forest System including, but not restricted to, forest mortality, growth, salvage potential, potential increased forest products sales, economic constraints, alternate markets, contract considerations, and other multiple use considerations;\n  (2) the potential for increased utilization of forest and wood product wastes in the National Forest System and on other lands, and of urban wood wastes and wood product recycling, including recommendations to the Congress for actions which would lead to increased utilization of material now being wasted both in the forests and in manufactured products; and\n  (3) the milling and other wood fiber product fabrication facilities and their location in the United States, noting the public and private forested areas that supply such facilities, assessing the degree of utilization into product form of harvested trees by such facilities, and setting forth the technology appropriate to the facilities to improve utilization either individually or in aggregate units of harvested trees and to reduce wasted wood fibers. The Secretary shall set forth a program to encourage the adoption by these facilities of these technologies for improving wood fiber utilization.\n(d) Public involvement; consultation with governmental departments and agencies. In developing the reports required under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall provide opportunity for public involvement and shall consult with other interested governmental departments and agencies.\n(e) Congressional policy of multiple use sustained yield management; examination and certification of lands; estimate of appropriations necessary for reforestation and other treatment; budget requirements; authorization of appropriations.\n  (1) It is the policy of the Congress that all forested lands in the National Forest System shall be maintained in appropriate forest cover with species of trees, degree of stocking, rate of growth, and conditions of stand designed to secure the maximum benefits of multiple use sustained yield management in accordance with land management plans. Accordingly, the Secretary is directed to identify and report to the Congress annually at the time of submission of the President\u2019s budget together with the annual report provided for under section 1606(c) of this title, beginning with submission of the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1978, the amount and location by forests and States and by productivity class, where practicable, of all lands in the National Forest System where objectives of land management plans indicate the need to reforest areas that have been cut-over or otherwise denuded or deforested, and all lands with stands of trees that are not growing at their best potential rate of growth. All national forest lands treated from year to year shall be examined after the first and third growing seasons and certified by the Secretary in the report provided for under this subsection as to stocking rate, growth rate in relation to potential and other pertinent measures. Any lands not certified as satisfactory shall be returned to the backlog and scheduled for prompt treatment. The level and types of treatment shall be those which secure the most effective mix of multiple use benefits.\n  (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1607 of this title, the Secretary shall, annually during each of the 10 years beginning after November 15, 2021, transmit to the Congress in the manner provided in this subsection an estimate of the sums necessary to be appropriated, in addition to the funds available from other sources, to replant and otherwise treat an acreage equal to the acreage to be cut over that year, plus a sufficient portion of the backlog of lands found to be in need of treatment to eliminate the backlog within the 10-year period. After the 10-year period, the Secretary shall transmit annually to the Congress an estimate of the sums necessary to replant and otherwise treat all lands being cut over and maintain planned timber production on all other forested lands in the National Forest System so as to prevent the development of a backlog of needed work larger than the needed work at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Secretary\u2019s estimate of sums necessary, in addition to the sums available under other authorities, for accomplishment of the reforestation and other treatment of National Forest System lands under this section shall be provided annually for inclusion in the President\u2019s budget and shall also be transmitted to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate together with the annual report provided for under section 1606(c) of this title at the time of submission of the President\u2019s budget to the Congress beginning with the budget for fiscal year 2021. The sums estimated as necessary for reforestation and other treatment shall include moneys needed to secure seed, grow seedlings, prepare sites, plant trees, thin, remove deleterious growth and underbrush, build fence to exclude livestock and adverse wildlife from regeneration areas and otherwise establish and improve growing forests to secure planned production of trees and other multiple use values.\n  (3) Effective for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1977, and each fiscal year thereafter, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated for the purpose of reforesting and treating lands in the National Forest System $200,000,000 annually to meet requirements of this subsection.

In taking actions to manage the spectrum to be made available for use by the private mobile services, the Commission shall consider, consistent with section 151 of this title, whether such actions will\u2014\n  (1) promote the safety of life and property;\n  (2) improve the efficiency of spectrum use and reduce the regulatory burden upon spectrum users, based upon sound engineering principles, user operational requirements, and marketplace demands;\n  (3) encourage competition and provide services to the largest feasible number of users; or\n  (4) increase interservice sharing opportunities between private mobile services and other services.\n(b) Advisory coordinating committees.\n  (1) The Commission, in coordinating the assignment of frequencies to stations in the private mobile services and in the fixed services (as defined by the Commission by rule), shall have authority to utilize assistance furnished by advisory coordinating committees consisting of individuals who are not officers or employees of the Federal Government.\n  (2) The authority of the Commission established in this subsection shall not be subject to or affected by the provisions of part III of title 5 or section 1342 of title 31.\n  (3) Any person who provides assistance to the Commission under this subsection shall not be considered, by reason of having provided such assistance, a Federal employee.\n  (4) Any advisory coordinating committee which furnishes assistance to the Commission under this subsection shall not be subject to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.\n(c) Regulatory treatment of mobile services.\n  (1) Common carrier treatment of commercial mobile services.\n    (A) A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a commercial mobile service shall, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for purposes of this chapter, except for such provisions of subchapter II as the Commission may specify by regulation as inapplicable to that service or person. In prescribing or amending any such regulation, the Commission may not specify any provision of section 201, 202, or 208 of this title, and may specify any other provision only if the Commission determines that\u2014\n      (i) enforcement of such provision is not necessary in order to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications, or regulations for or in connection with that service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;\n      (ii) enforcement of such provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and\n      (iii) specifying such provision is consistent with the public interest.\n    (B) Upon reasonable request of any person providing commercial mobile service, the Commission shall order a common carrier to establish physical connections with such service pursuant to the provisions of section 201 of this title. Except to the extent that the Commission is required to respond to such a request, this subparagraph shall not be construed as a limitation or expansion of the Commission\u2019s authority to order interconnection pursuant to this chapter.\n    (C) As a part of making a determination with respect to the public interest under subparagraph (A)(iii), the Commission shall consider whether the proposed regulation (or amendment thereof) will promote competitive market conditions, including the extent to which such regulation (or amendment) will enhance competition among providers of commercial mobile services. If the Commission determines that such regulation (or amendment) will promote competition among providers of commercial mobile services, such determination may be the basis for a Commission finding that such regulation (or amendment) is in the public interest.\n    (D) The Commission shall, not later than 180 days after August 10, 1993, complete a rulemaking required to implement this paragraph with respect to the licensing of personal communications services, including making any determinations required by subparagraph (C).\n  (2) Non-common carrier treatment of private mobile services. A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a private mobile service shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for any purpose under this chapter. A common carrier (other than a person that was treated as a provider of a private land mobile service prior to August 10, 1993) shall not provide any dispatch service on any frequency allocated for common carrier service, except to the extent such dispatch service is provided on stations licensed in the domestic public land mobile radio service before January 1, 1982. The Commission may by regulation terminate, in whole or in part, the prohibition contained in the preceding sentence if the Commission determines that such termination will serve the public interest.\n  (3) State preemption.\n    (A) Notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title, no State or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service, except that this paragraph shall not prohibit a State from regulating the other terms and conditions of commercial mobile services. Nothing in this subparagraph shall exempt providers of commercial mobile services (where such services are a substitute for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the communications within such State) from requirements imposed by a State commission on all providers of telecommunications services necessary to ensure the universal availability of telecommunications service at affordable rates. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this subparagraph, a State may petition the Commission for authority to regulate the rates for any commercial mobile service and the Commission shall grant such petition if such State demonstrates that\u2014\n      (i) market conditions with respect to such services fail to protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory; or\n      (ii) such market conditions exist and such service is a replacement for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the telephone land line exchange service within such State.\n    The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition. If the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall authorize the State to exercise under State law such authority over rates, for such periods of time, as the Commission deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.\n    (B) If a State has in effect on June 1, 1993, any regulation concerning the rates for any commercial mobile service offered in such State on such date, such State may, no later than 1 year after August 10, 1993, petition the Commission requesting that the State be authorized to continue exercising authority over such rates. If a State files such a petition, the State\u2019s existing regulation shall, notwithstanding subparagraph (A), remain in effect until the Commission completes all action (including any reconsideration) on such petition. The Commission shall review such petition in accordance with the procedures established in such subparagraph, shall complete all action (including any reconsideration) within 12 months after such petition is filed, and shall grant such petition if the State satisfies the showing required under subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii). If the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall authorize the State to exercise under State law such authority over rates, for such period of time, as the Commission deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. After a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Commission, has elapsed from the issuance of an order under subparagraph (A) or this subparagraph, any interested party may petition the Commission for an order that the exercise of authority by a State pursuant to such subparagraph is no longer necessary to ensure that the rates for commercial mobile services are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition in whole or in part.\n  (4) Regulatory treatment of communications satellite corporation. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to alter or affect the regulatory treatment required by title IV of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 [47 U.S.C. 741 et seq.] of the corporation authorized by title III of such Act [ 47 U.S.C. 731 et seq.].\n  (5) Space segment capacity. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission from continuing to determine whether the provision of space segment capacity by satellite systems to providers of commercial mobile services shall be treated as common carriage.\n  (6) Foreign ownership. The Commission, upon a petition for waiver filed within 6 months after August 10, 1993, may waive the application of section 310(b) of this title to any foreign ownership that lawfully existed before May 24, 1993, of any provider of a private land mobile service that will be treated as a common carrier as a result of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, but only upon the following conditions:\n    (A) The extent of foreign ownership interest shall not be increased above the extent which existed on May 24, 1993.\n    (B) Such waiver shall not permit the subsequent transfer of ownership to any other person in violation of section 310(b) of this title.\n  (7) Preservation of local zoning authority.\n    (A) General authority. Except as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities.\n    (B) Limitations.\n      (i) The regulation of the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities by any State or local government or instrumentality thereof\u2014\n        (I) shall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; and\n        (II) shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.\n      (ii) A State or local government or instrumentality thereof shall act on any request for authorization to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with such government or instrumentality, taking into account the nature and scope of such request.\n      (iii) Any decision by a State or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.\n      (iv) No State or local government or instrumentality thereof may regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Commission\u2019s regulations concerning such emissions.\n      (v) Any person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure to act, commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction. The court shall hear and decide such action on an expedited basis. Any person adversely affected by an act or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with clause (iv) may petition the Commission for relief.\n    (C) Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph\u2014\n      (i) the term \u201cpersonal wireless services\u201d means commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless services, and common carrier wireless exchange access services;\n      (ii) the term \u201cpersonal wireless service facilities\u201d means facilities for the provision of personal wireless services; and\n      (iii) the term \u201cunlicensed wireless service\u201d means the offering of telecommunications services using duly authorized devices which do not require individual licenses, but does not mean the provision of direct-to-home satellite services (as defined in section 303(v) of this title).\n  (8) Mobile services access. A person engaged in the provision of commercial mobile services, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not be required to provide equal access to common carriers for the provision of telephone toll services.

Participation of local governments in revenue from areas administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n(a) Separate fund in the United States Treasury; availability of funds until expended; \u201cNational Wildlife Refuge System\u201d defined. Beginning with the next full fiscal year and for each fiscal year thereafter, all revenues received by the Secretary of the Interior from the sale or other disposition of animals, salmonoid carcassas, timber, hay, grass, or other products of the soil, minerals, shells, sand, or gravel, from other privileges, or from leases for public accommodations or facilities incidental to but not in conflict with the basic purposes for which those areas of the National Wildlife Refuge System were established, during each fiscal year in connection with the operation and management of those areas of the National Wildlife Refuge System, National Fish Hatcheries, or other areas, that are solely or primarily administered by him, through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, shall be covered into the United States Treasury and be reserved in a separate fund for disposition as hereafter prescribed. Amounts in the fund shall remain available until expended, and may be expended by the Secretary without further appropriation in the manner hereafter prescribed. The National Wildlife Refuge System (hereafter referred to as the \u201cSystem\u201d) includes those lands and waters administered by the Secretary as wildlife refuges, lands acquired or reserved for the protection and conservation of fish and wildlife that are listed pursuant to section 1533 of this title as endangered species or threatened species, wildlife ranges, game ranges, wildlife management areas, and waterfowl production areas established under any law, proclamation, Executive, or public land order.\n(b) Deduction of expenses. The Secretary may pay from the fund any necessary expenses incurred by him in connection with the revenue-producing and revenue-sharing measures.\n(c) Payment to counties.\n  (1) The Secretary shall pay out the fund, for each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 1979, to each county in which is situated any fee area whichever of the following amounts is greater:\n    (A) An amount equal to the product of 75 cents multiplied by the total acreage of that portion of the fee area which is located within such county.\n    (B) An amount equal to three-fourths of 1 per centum of the fair market value, as determined by the Secretary, of that portion of the fee area (excluding any improvements thereto made after the date of Federal acquisition) which is located within such county.\n    (C) An amount equal to 25 per centum of the net receipts collected by the Secretary in connection with the operation and management of such fee area during such fiscal year; but if a fee area is located in two or more counties, the amount each such county is entitled to shall be the amount which bears to such 25 per centum the same ratio as that portion of the fee area acreage which is within such county bears to the total acreage of such fee area.\n  (2) At the end of each fiscal year the Secretary shall pay out of the fund for such fiscal year to each county in which any reserve area is situated, an amount equal to 25 per centum of the net receipts collected by the Secretary in connection with the operation and management of such area during such fiscal year: Provided, That when any such area is situated in more than one county the distributive share to each county from the aforesaid receipts shall be proportional to its acreage of such reserve area.\n  (3) For purposes of this section, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands shall each be treated as a county.\n  (4)\n    (A) For purposes of determining the fair market value of fee areas under paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall\u2014\n      (i) appraise before September 30, 1979, all fee areas for which payments under this section were not authorized for fiscal years occurring before October 1, 1977; and\n      (ii) appraise all other fee areas, within five years after October 17, 1978, in the order in which such areas were first established by the Service.\n    After initial appraisal under clause (i) or (ii), each fee area shall thereafter be reappraised by the Secretary at least once during each five-year period occurring after the date of the initial appraisal. Until any fee area referred to in clause (ii) is initially appraised under this subparagraph, the fair market value of such area shall be deemed to be that adjusted cost of the area which was used to determine payments under this subsection for fiscal year 1977; and in no case may the amount of any payment to any local government under paragraph (1)(B) with respect to any fee area be less than the amount paid under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection (as in effect on September 30, 1977) with respect to such area.\n    (B) The Secretary shall make the determinations required under this subsection in such manner as the Secretary considers to be equitable and in the public interest. All such determinations shall be final and conclusive.\n  (5)\n    (A) Each county which receives payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) with respect to any fee area or reserve area shall distribute, under guidelines established by the Secretary, such payments on a proportional basis to those units of local government (including, but not limited to, school districts and the county itself in appropriate cases) which have incurred the loss or reduction of real property tax revenues by reason of the existence of such area. In any case in which a unit of local government other than the county acts as the collecting and distributing agency for real property taxes, the payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made to such other unit which shall distribute the payments in accordance with the guidelines.\n    (B) The Secretary may prescribe regulations under which payments under this paragraph may be made to units of local government in cases in which subparagraph (A) will not effect the purposes of this paragraph.\n    (C) Payments received by units of local government under this subsection may be used by such units for any governmental purpose.\n(d) Authorization of appropriations equal to difference between amount of net receipts and aggregate amount of required payments. If the net receipts in the fund which are attributable to revenue collections for any fiscal year do not equal the aggregate amount of payments required to be made for such fiscal year under subsection (c) to counties, there are authorized to be appropriated to the fund an amount equal to the difference between the total amount of net receipts and such aggregate amount of payments.\n(e) Transfer and use of excess of net receipts over aggregate amount of required payments. If the net receipts in the fund which are attributable to revenue collections for any fiscal year exceed the aggregate amount of payments required to be made for such fiscal year under subsection (c) to counties, the amount of such excess shall be transferred to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund for use in the acquisition of suitable areas for migratory bird refuges under the provisions of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 715\u2013715r).\n(f) Terms, conditions, and regulations for execution of revenue producing activities; disposal of animals. The Secretary shall carry out any revenue producing activity referred to in subsection (a)(1), (2), and (3) within any fee area or reserve area subject to such terms, conditions, or regulations, including sales in the open markets, as the Secretary determines to be in the best interest of the United States. The Secretary may, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, dispose of animals which are surplus to any such area by exchange of the same or other kinds, gift or loan to public institutions for exhibition or propagation purposes, and for the advancement of knowledge and the dissemination of information relating to the conservation of wildlife.\n(g) Definitions. As used in this section\u2014\n  (1) The term \u201cSecretary\u201d means the Secretary of the Interior.\n  (2) The term \u201cfee area\u201d means any area which was acquired in fee by the United States and is administered, either solely or primarily, by the Secretary through the Service.\n  (3) The term \u201creserve area\u201d means any area of land withdrawn from the public domain and administered, either solely or primarily, by the Secretary through the Service.\n  (4) The term \u201cService\u201d means the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  (5) The term \u201ccounty\u201d means any county, parish, or organized or unorganized borough.\n\n\u00a7 4715.

{"id": "test4k_usc_c2def_52", "task": "cite2defined", "texttype": "uscode", "prompt": "\u00a7 532. Cable channels for commercial use.\n(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote competition in the delivery of diverse sources of video programming and to assure that the widest possible diversity of information sources are made available to the public from cable systems in a manner consistent with growth and development of cable systems.\n(b) Designation of channel capacity for commercial use.\n  (1) A cable operator shall designate channel capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator in accordance with the following requirements:\n    (A) An operator of any cable system with 36 or more (but not more than 54) activated channels shall designate 10 percent of such channels which are not otherwise required for use (or the use of which is not prohibited) by Federal law or regulation.\n    (B) An operator of any cable system with 55 or more (but not more than 100) activated channels shall designate 15 percent of such channels which are not otherwise required for use (or the use of which is not prohibited) by Federal law or regulation.\n    (C) An operator of any cable system with more than 100 activated channels shall designate 15 percent of all such channels.\n    (D) An operator of any cable system with fewer than 36 activated channels shall not be required to designate channel capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator, unless the cable system is required to provide such channel capacity under the terms of a franchise in effect on October 30, 1984.\n    (E) An operator of any cable system in operation on October 30, 1984, shall not be required to remove any service actually being provided on July 1, 1984, in order to comply with this section, but shall make channel capacity available for commercial use as such capacity becomes available until such time as the cable operator is in full compliance with this section.\n  (2) Any Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may not require any cable system to designate channel capacity for commercial use by unaffiliated persons in excess of the capacity specified in paragraph (1), except as otherwise provided in this section.\n  (3) A cable operator may not be required, as part of a request for proposals or as part of a proposal for renewal, subject to section 546 of this title, to designate channel capacity for any use (other than commercial use by unaffiliated persons under this section) except as provided in sections 531 and 557 of this title, but a cable operator may offer in a franchise, or proposal for renewal thereof, to provide, consistent with applicable law, such capacity for other than commercial use by such persons.\n  (4) A cable operator may use any unused channel capacity designated pursuant to this section until the use of such channel capacity is obtained, pursuant to a written agreement, by a person unaffiliated with the operator.\n  (5) For the purposes of this section, the term \u201ccommercial use\u201d means the provision of video programming, whether or not for profit.\n  (6) Any channel capacity which has been designated for public, educational, or governmental use may not be considered as designated under this section for commercial use for purpose of this section.\n(c) Use of channel capacity by unaffiliated persons; editorial control; restriction on service; rules on rates, terms, and conditions.\n  (1) If a person unaffiliated with the cable operator seeks to use channel capacity designated pursuant to subsection (b) for commercial use, the cable operator shall establish, consistent with the purpose of this section and with rules prescribed by the Commission under paragraph (4), the price, terms, and conditions of such use which are at least sufficient to assure that such use will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market development of the cable system.\n  (2) A cable operator shall not exercise any editorial control over any video programming provided pursuant to this section, or in any other way consider the content of such programming, except that a cable operator may refuse to transmit any leased access program or portion of a leased access program which contains obscenity, indecency, or nudity and may consider such content to the minimum extent necessary to establish a reasonable price for the commercial use of designated channel capacity by an unaffiliated person.\n  (3) Any cable system channel designated in accordance with this section shall not be used to provide a cable service that is being provided over such system on October 30, 1984, if the provision of such programming is intended to avoid the purpose of this section.\n  (4)\n    (A) The Commission shall have the authority to\u2014\n      (i) determine the maximum reasonable rates that a cable operator may establish pursuant to paragraph (1) for commercial use of designated channel capacity, including the rate charged for the billing of rates to subscribers and for the collection of revenue from subscribers by the cable operator for such use;\n      (ii) establish reasonable terms and conditions for such use, including those for billing and collection; and\n      (iii) establish procedures for the expedited resolution of disputes concerning rates or carriage under this section.\n    (B) Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall establish rules for determining maximum reasonable rates under subparagraph (A)(i), for establishing terms and conditions under subparagraph (A)(ii), and for providing procedures under subparagraph (A)(iii).\n(d) Right of action in district court; relief; factors not to be considered by court. Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make channel capacity available for use pursuant to this section may bring an action in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the cable system is located to compel that such capacity be made available. If the court finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not been made available in accordance with this section, or finds that the price, terms, or conditions established by the cable operator are unreasonable, the court may order such system to make available to such person the channel capacity sought, and further determine the appropriate price, terms, or conditions for such use consistent with subsection (c), and may award actual damages if it deems such relief appropriate. In any such action, the court shall not consider any price, term, or condition established between an operator and an affiliate for comparable services.\n(e) Petition to Commission; relief.\n  (1) Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make channel capacity available pursuant to this section may petition the Commission for relief under this subsection upon a showing of prior adjudicated violations of this section. Records of previous adjudications resulting in a court determination that the operator has violated this section shall be considered as sufficient for the showing necessary under this subsection. If the Commission finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not been made available in accordance with this section, or that the price, terms, or conditions established by such system are unreasonable under subsection (c), the Commission shall, by rule or order, require such operator to make available such channel capacity under price, terms, and conditions consistent with subsection (c).\n  (2) In any case in which the Commission finds that the prior adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of violations by an operator, the Commission may also establish any further rule or order necessary to assure that the operator provides the diversity of information sources required by this section.\n  (3) In any case in which the Commission finds that the prior adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of violations by any person who is an operator of more than one cable system, the Commission may also establish any further rule or order necessary to assure that such person provides the diversity of information sources required by this section.\n(f) Presumption of reasonableness and good faith. In any action brought under this section in any Federal district court or before the Commission, there shall be a presumption that the price, terms, and conditions for use of channel capacity designated pursuant to subsection (b) are reasonable and in good faith unless shown by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\n(g) Promulgation of rules. Notwithstanding sections 541(c) and 543(a) of this title, at such time as cable systems with 36 or more activated channels are available to 70 percent of households within the United States and are subscribed to by 70 percent of the households to which such systems are available, the Commission may promulgate any additional rules necessary to provide diversity of information sources. Any rules promulgated by the Commission pursuant to this subsection shall not preempt authority expressly granted to franchising authorities under this subchapter.\n(h) Cable service unprotected by Constitution. Any cable service offered pursuant to this section shall not be provided, or shall be provided subject to conditions, if such cable service in the judgment of the franchising authority or the cable operator is obscene, or is in conflict with community standards in that it is lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent or is otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of the United States. This subsection shall permit a cable operator to enforce prospectively a written and published policy of prohibiting programming that the cable operator reasonably believes describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards.\n(i) Programming from qualified minority or educational programming sources.\n  (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b) and (c), a cable operator required by this section to designate channel capacity for commercial use may use any such channel capacity for the provision of programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source, whether or not such source is affiliated with the cable operator. The channel capacity used to provide programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source pursuant to this subsection may not exceed 33 percent of the channel capacity designated pursuant to this section. No programming provided over a cable system on July 1, 1990, may qualify as minority programming or educational programming on that cable system under this subsection.\n  (2) For purposes of this subsection, the term \u201cqualified minority programming source\u201d means a programming source which devotes substantially all of its programming to coverage of minority viewpoints, or to programming directed at members of minority groups, and which is over 50 percent minority-owned, as the term \u201cminority\u201d is defined in section 309(i)(3)(C)(ii) of this title.\n  (3) For purposes of this subsection, the term \u201cqualified educational programming source\u201d means a programming source which devotes substantially all of its programming to educational or instructional programming that promotes public understanding of mathematics, the sciences, the humanities, and the arts and has a documented annual expenditure on programming exceeding $15,000,000.

The Secretary of Labor (in this section referred to as the \u201cSecretary\u201d) shall award grants under this section for a fiscal year to eligible States to conduct a program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments for individuals referred to reemployment services as described in section 503(j) of this title for weeks in such fiscal year for which such individuals receive unemployment compensation.\n(b) Purposes. The purposes of this section are to accomplish the following goals:\n  (1) To improve employment outcomes of individuals that receive unemployment compensation and to reduce the average duration of receipt of such compensation through employment.\n  (2) To strengthen program integrity and reduce improper payments of unemployment compensation by States through the detection and prevention of such payments to individuals who are not eligible for such compensation.\n  (3) To promote alignment with the broader vision of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) of increased program integration and service delivery for job seekers, including claimants for unemployment compensation.\n  (4) To establish reemployment services and eligibility assessments as an entry point for individuals receiving unemployment compensation into other workforce system partner programs.\n(c) Evidence-based standards.\n  (1) In general. In carrying out a State program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments using grant funds awarded to the State under this section, a State shall use such funds only for interventions demonstrated to reduce the number of weeks for which program participants receive unemployment compensation by improving employment outcomes for program participants.\n  (2) Expanding evidence-based interventions. In addition to the requirement imposed by paragraph (1), a State shall\u2014\n    (A) for fiscal years 2023 and 2024, use no less than 25 percent of the grant funds awarded to the State under this section for interventions with a high or moderate causal evidence rating that show a demonstrated capacity to improve employment and earnings outcomes for program participants;\n    (B) for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, use no less than 40 percent of such grant funds for interventions described in subparagraph (A); and\n    (C) for fiscal years beginning after fiscal year 2026, use no less than 50 percent of such grant funds for interventions described in subparagraph (A).\n(d) Evaluations.\n  (1) Required evaluations.

A State shall use not more than 10 percent of grant funds awarded to the State under this section to conduct or cause to be conducted evaluations of interventions used in carrying out a program under this section (including evaluations conducted pursuant to paragraph (1)).\n(e) State plan.\n  (1) In general. As a condition of eligibility to receive a grant under this section for a fiscal year, a State shall submit to the Secretary, at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may require, a State plan that outlines how the State intends to conduct a program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments under this section, including\u2014\n    (A) assurances that, and a description of how, the program will provide\u2014\n      (i) proper notification to participating individuals of the program\u2019s eligibility conditions, requirements, and benefits, including the issuance of warnings and simple, clear notifications to ensure that participating individuals are fully aware of the consequences of failing to adhere to such requirements, including policies related to non-attendance or non-fulfillment of work search requirements; and\n      (ii) reasonable scheduling accommodations to maximize participation for eligible individuals;\n    (B) assurances that, and a description of how, the program will conform with the purposes outlined in subsection (b) and satisfy the requirement to use evidence-based standards under subsection (c), including\u2014\n      (i) a description of the evidence-based interventions the State plans to use to speed reemployment;\n      (ii) an explanation of how such interventions are appropriate to the population served; and\n      (iii) if applicable, a description of the evaluation structure the State plans to use for interventions without at least a moderate or high causal evidence rating, which may include national evaluations conducted by the Department of Labor or by other entities; and\n    (C) a description of any reemployment activities and evaluations conducted in the prior fiscal year, and any data collected on\u2014\n      (i) characteristics of program participants;\n      (ii) the number of weeks for which program participants receive unemployment compensation; and\n      (iii) employment and other outcomes for program participants consistent with State performance accountability measures provided by the State unemployment compensation program and in section 116(b) of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3141(b)).\n  (2) Approval. The Secretary shall approve any State plan, that is timely submitted to the Secretary, in such manner as the Secretary may require, that satisfies the conditions described in paragraph (1).\n  (3) Disapproval and revision. If the Secretary determines that a State plan submitted pursuant to this subsection fails to satisfy the conditions described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall\u2014\n    (A) disapprove such plan;\n    (B) provide to the State, not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the State plan, a written notice of such disapproval that includes a description of any portion of the plan that was not approved and the reason for the disapproval of each such portion; and\n    (C) provide the State with an opportunity to correct any such failure and submit a revised State plan.\n(f) Allocation of funds.\n  (1) Base funding.\n    (A) In general. For each fiscal year after fiscal year 2020, the Secretary shall allocate a percentage equal to the base funding percentage for such fiscal year of the funds made available for grants under this section among the States awarded such a grant for such fiscal year using a formula prescribed by the Secretary based on the rate of insured unemployment (as defined in section 203(e)(1) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note)) in the State for a period to be determined by the Secretary.

Not later than 90 days prior to making any changes to the allocation formula or the criteria developed pursuant to subsection (f)(5)(A), the Secretary shall submit to Congress, including to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, a notification of any such change.\n(h) Supplement not supplant. Funds made available to carry out this section shall be used to supplement the level of Federal, State, and local public funds that, in the absence of such availability, would be expended to provide reemployment services and eligibility assessments to individuals receiving unemployment compensation, and in no case to supplant such Federal, State, or local public funds.\n(i) Definitions.

To achieve the purpose of this subchapter, the Secretary, acting through the National Park Service, in cooperation with appropriate State and Federal agencies, local units of government and local residents shall formulate a comprehensive plan for the protection, preservation, and interpretation of the reserve. The plan shall identify those areas or zones within the reserve which would most appropriately be devoted to\u2014\n  (1) public use and development;\n  (2) historic and natural preservation; and\n  (3) private use subject to appropriate local ordinances designed to protect the historic rural setting.\n(b) Transmittal of plan to Congress and State. Within eighteen months following November 18, 1988, the Secretary shall transmit the plan to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the Governor of the State of Idaho.\n(c) Transfer of management and administration to State or local units of government. At such time as the State or appropriate units of local government having jurisdiction over land use within the reserve have enacted ordinances or established regulations which in the judgment of the Secretary will protect and preserve the historic and natural features of the area in accordance with the comprehensive plan, the Secretary shall, pursuant to cooperative agreement\u2014\n  (1) transfer management and administration over all or any part of the property acquired under subsection (d) of this section to the State or appropriate units of local government;\n  (2) provide technical assistance to such State or units of local government in the management, protection, and interpretation of the reserve; and\n  (3) make periodic grants, which shall be supplemental to any other funds to which the grantee may be entitled under any other provision of law, to such State or local unit of government to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.\n(d) Acquisition of land.\n  (1) The Secretary is authorized to acquire such lands and interests as he determines are necessary to accomplish the purposes of this subchapter by donation, purchase with donated funds, or appropriated funds, or exchange, except that the Secretary may not acquire the fee simple title to any land without the consent of the owner. The Secretary shall, in addition, give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by an individual owning property within the reserve to sell such property, if such individual notifies the Secretary that the continued ownership of such property is causing, or would result in, undue hardship.\n  (2) Lands and waters, and interests therein, within the boundaries of the reserve which were administered by the Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture or the Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior prior to November 18, 1988, are hereby transferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary to be administered by the National Park Service in accordance with this subchapter.\n  (3) Lands and interest therein so acquired shall, so long as responsibility for management and administration remains with the United States, be administered by the Secretary subject to the provisions of the Act of August 25, 1916 ( 39 Stat. 535), as amended and supplemented, and in a manner consistent with the purpose of this subchapter.\n(e) Withdrawal of management and administration from State or local units of government. If, after the transfer of management and administration of any lands pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary determines that the reserve is not being managed in a manner consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, he shall so notify the appropriate officers of the State or local unit of government to which such transfer was made and provide for a one hundred and eighty-day period in which the transferee may make such modifications in applicable laws, ordinances, rules, and procedures as will be consistent with such purposes. If, upon the expiration of such one hundred and eighty-day period, the Secretary determines that such modifications have not been made or are inadequate, he shall withdraw the management and administration from the transferee and he shall manage such lands in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.\n(f) Water rights. Congress finds that there are unique circumstances with respect to the water and water related resources within the Reserve designated by this subchapter. The Congress recognizes that the management of this area may be transferred to the State of Idaho, that the State has committed to providing the water necessary to fulfill the purposes of this subchapter, and that there is little or no water or water-related resources that require the protection of a Federal reserved water right. Nothing in this subchapter, nor any action taken pursuant thereto, shall constitute either an express or implied reservation of water or water right for any purpose: Provided, That the United States shall retain that reserved water right which is associated with the initial establishment and withdrawal of the national forest lands which will be transferred to the Reserve under this subchapter.\n(g) Withdrawal of lands from disposition under other laws. Subject to valid existing rights, Federal lands and interests therein, within the reserve, are hereby withdrawn from disposition under the public land laws and from entry or appropriation under the mining laws of the United States, from the operation of the mineral leasing laws of the United States, and from operation of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended [30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.].\n(h) Authorization of appropriations. There is hereby authorized to be appropriated not to exceed $2,000,000 to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.\n\n\u00a7 720. Declaration of policy; authorization of appropriations.\n(a) Findings; purpose; policy.\n  (1) Findings. Congress finds that\u2014\n    (A) work\u2014\n      (i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and\n      (ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in the United States;\n    (B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;\n    (C) individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in competitive integrated employment settings if appropriate services and supports are provided;\n    (D) reasons for significant numbers of individuals with disabilities not working, or working at levels not commensurate with their abilities and capabilities, include\u2014\n      (i) discrimination;\n      (ii) lack of accessible and available transportation;\n      (iii) fear of losing health coverage under the Medicare and Medicaid programs carried out under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq. and 1396 et seq.) or fear of losing private health insurance; and\n      (iv) lack of education, training, and supports to meet job qualification standards necessary to secure, retain, regain, or advance in employment;\n    (E) enforcement of subchapter V and of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) holds the promise of ending discrimination for individuals with disabilities;\n    (F) the provision of workforce development activities and vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, to pursue meaningful careers by securing gainful employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities; and\n    (G) linkages between the vocational rehabilitation programs established under this subchapter and other components of the statewide workforce development systems are critical to ensure effective and meaningful participation by individuals with disabilities in workforce development activities.\n  (2) Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to assist States in operating statewide comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable programs of vocational rehabilitation, each of which is\u2014\n    (A) an integral part of a statewide workforce development system; and\n    (B) designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, informed choice, and economic self-sufficiency, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.\n  (3) Policy. It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:\n    (A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.\n    (B) Individuals with disabilities must be provided the opportunities to obtain competitive integrated employment.\n    (C) Individuals who are applicants for such programs or eligible to participate in such programs must be active and full partners in the vocational rehabilitation process, making meaningful and informed choices\u2014\n      (i) during assessments for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs; and\n      (ii) in the selection of employment outcomes for the individuals, services needed to achieve the outcomes, entities providing such services, and the methods used to secure such services.\n    (D) Families and other natural supports can play important roles in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if the individual with a disability involved requests, desires, or needs such supports.\n    (E) Vocational rehabilitation counselors that are trained and prepared in accordance with State policies and procedures as described in section 721(a)(7)(B) of this title (referred to individually in this subchapter as a \u201cqualified vocational rehabilitation counselor\u201d), other qualified rehabilitation personnel, and other qualified personnel should facilitate the accomplishment of the employment outcomes and objectives of an individual.\n    (F) Individuals with disabilities and the individuals\u2019 representatives are full partners in a vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.\n    (G) Accountability measures must facilitate the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program, including providing vocational rehabilitation services to, among others, individuals with the most significant disabilities.\n(b) Authorization of appropriations.\n  (1) In general. For the purpose of making grants to States under part B to assist States in meeting the costs of vocational rehabilitation services provided in accordance with State plans under section 721 of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated $3,302,053,000 for each of the fiscal years 2015 through 2020, except that the amount to be appropriated for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of the appropriation under this paragraph for the immediately preceding fiscal year, increased by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index determined under subsection (c) for the immediately preceding fiscal year.\n  (2) Reference. The reference in paragraph (1) to grants to States under part B shall not be considered to refer to grants under section 732 of this title.\n(c) Consumer Price Index.\n  (1) Percentage change. No later than November 15 of each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1979), the Secretary of Labor shall publish in the Federal Register the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published for October of the preceding fiscal year and October of the fiscal year in which such publication is made.\n  (2) Application.\n    (A) Increase. If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) indicates an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1) increased by such percentage change.\n    (B) No increase or decrease. If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) does not indicate an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1).\n  (3) Definition. For purposes of this section, the term \u201cConsumer Price Index\u201d means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n(d) Extension.\n  (1) In general.\n    (A) Authorization or duration of program. Unless the Congress in the regular session which ends prior to the beginning of the terminal fiscal year\u2014\n      (i) of the authorization of appropriations for the program authorized by the State grant program under part B of this subchapter; or\n      (ii) of the duration of the program authorized by the State grant program under part B of this subchapter;\n    has passed legislation which would have the effect of extending the authorization or duration (as the case may be) of such program, such authorization or duration is automatically extended for 1 additional year for the program authorized by this subchapter.\n    (B) Calculation. The amount authorized to be appropriated for the additional fiscal year described in subparagraph (A) shall be an amount equal to the amount appropriated for such program for fiscal year 2003, increased by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index determined under subsection (c) for the immediately preceding fiscal year, if the percentage change indicates an increase.\n  (2) Construction.\n    (A) Passage of legislation. For the purposes of paragraph (1)(A), Congress shall not be deemed to have passed legislation unless such legislation becomes law.\n    (B) Acts or determinations of Commissioner. In any case where the Commissioner is required under an applicable statute to carry out certain acts or make certain determinations which are necessary for the continuation of the program authorized by this subchapter, if such acts or determinations are required during the terminal year of such program, such acts and determinations shall be required during any fiscal year in which the extension described in that part of paragraph (1) that follows clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) is in effect.\n\nWhat is the term defined at section 720(c)(3) above?", "idx_line": 55, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 460yy\u20131", "line_text": "\u00a7 460yy\u20131.

Withholding of foreign assistance from countries supporting Juragua nuclear plant in Cuba.\n(a) Findings. The Congress makes the following findings:\n  (1) President Clinton stated in April 1993 that the United States opposed the construction of the Juragua nuclear power plant because of the concerns of the United States about Cuba\u2019s ability to ensure the safe operation of the facility and because of Cuba\u2019s refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or ratify the Treaty of Tlatelolco.\n  (2) Cuba has not signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons or ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the latter of which establishes Latin America and the Caribbean as a nuclear weapons-free zone.\n  (3) The State Department, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Energy have expressed concerns about the construction and operation of Cuba\u2019s nuclear reactors.\n  (4) In a September 1992 report to the Congress, the General Accounting Office outlined concerns among nuclear energy experts about deficiencies in the nuclear plant project in Juragua, near Cienfuegos, Cuba, including\u2014\n    (A) a lack in Cuba of a nuclear regulatory structure;\n    (B) the absence in Cuba of an adequate infrastructure to ensure the plant\u2019s safe operation and requisite maintenance;\n    (C) the inadequacy of training of plant operators;\n    (D) reports by a former technician from Cuba who, by examining with x-rays weld sites believed to be part of the auxiliary plumbing system for the plant, found that 10 to 15 percent of those sites were defective;\n    (E) since September 5, 1992, when construction on the plant was halted, the prolonged exposure to the elements, including corrosive salt water vapor, of the primary reactor components; and\n    (F) the possible inadequacy of the upper portion of the reactors\u2019 dome retention capability to withstand only 7 pounds of pressure per square inch, given that normal atmospheric pressure is 32 pounds per square inch and United States reactors are designed to accommodate pressures of 50 pounds per square inch.\n  (5) The United States Geological Survey claims that it had difficulty determining answers to specific questions regarding earthquake activity in the area near Cienfuegos because the Cuban Government was not forthcoming with information.\n  (6) The Geological Survey has indicated that the Caribbean plate, a geological formation near the south coast of Cuba, may pose seismic risks to Cuba and the site of the power plant, and may produce large to moderate earthquakes.\n  (7) On May 25, 1992, the Caribbean plate produced an earthquake numbering 7.0 on the Richter scale.\n  (8) According to a study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, summer winds could carry radioactive pollutants from a nuclear accident at the power plant throughout all of Florida and parts of the States on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico as far as Texas, and northern winds could carry the pollutants as far northeast as Virginia and Washington, D.C.\n  (9) The Cuban Government, under dictator Fidel Castro, in 1962 advocated the Soviets\u2019 launching of nuclear missiles to the United States, which represented a direct and dangerous provocation of the United States and brought the world to the brink of a nuclear conflict.\n  (10) Fidel Castro over the years has consistently issued threats against the United States Government, most recently that he would unleash another perilous mass migration from Cuba upon the enactment of this chapter.\n  (11) Despite the various concerns about the plant\u2019s safety and operational problems, a feasibility study is being conducted that would establish a support group to include Russia, Cuba, and third countries with the objective of completing and operating the plant.\n(b) Withholding of foreign assistance.\n  (1) In general. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President shall withhold from assistance allocated, on or after March 12, 1996, for any country an amount equal to the sum of assistance and credits, if any, provided on or after March 12, 1996, by that country or any entity in that country in support of the completion of the Cuban nuclear facility at Juragua, near Cienfuegos, Cuba.\n  (2) Exceptions. The requirement of paragraph (1) to withhold assistance shall not apply with respect to\u2014\n    (A) assistance to meet urgent humanitarian needs, including disaster and refugee relief;\n    (B) democratic political reform or rule of law activities;\n    (C) the creation of private sector or nongovernmental organizations that are independent of government control;\n    (D) the development of a free market economic system;\n    (E) assistance for the purposes described in the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993 (title XII of Public Law 103\u2013160) [ 22 U.S.C. 5951 et seq.]; or\n    (F) assistance under the secondary school exchange program administered by the United States Information Agency.\n  (3) \u201cAssistance\u201d defined. As used in paragraph (1), the term \u201cassistance\u201d means assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], credits, sales, guarantees of extensions of credit, and other assistance under the Arms Export Control Act [ 22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.], assistance under titles I and III of the Food for Peace Act [ 7 U.S.C. 1701 et seq., 1727 et seq.], assistance under the FREEDOM Support Act, and any other program of assistance or credits provided by the United States to other countries under other provisions of law.\n\n\u00a7 8907. Sanctions on persons responsible for violence or undermining the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine.\n(a) In general. The President shall impose the sanctions described in subsection (b) with respect to\u2014\n  (1) any person, including a current or former official of the Government of Ukraine or a person acting on behalf of that Government, that the President determines has perpetrated, or is responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, significant acts of violence or gross human rights abuses in Ukraine against persons associated with the antigovernment protests in Ukraine that began on November 21, 2013;\n  (2) any person that the President determines has perpetrated, or is responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, significant acts that are intended to undermine the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine, including acts of economic extortion;\n  (3) any official of the Government of the Russian Federation, or a close associate or family member of such an official, that the President determines is responsible for, complicit in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, acts of significant corruption in Ukraine, including the expropriation of private or public assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, bribery, or the facilitation or transfer of the proceeds of corruption to foreign jurisdictions; and\n  (4) any individual that the President determines materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, the commission of acts described in paragraph (1), (2), or (3).\n(b) Sanctions described.\n  (1) In general. The sanctions described in this subsection are the following:\n    (A) Asset blocking.

In the case of an alien determined by the President to be subject to subsection (a), denial of a visa to, and exclusion from the United States of, the alien, and revocation in accordance with section 1201(i) of title 8, of any visa or other documentation of the alien.\n  (2) Penalties. A person that violates, attempts to violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of paragraph (1)(A) or any regulation, license, or order issued to carry out paragraph (1)(A) shall be subject to the penalties set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of section 206 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1705) to the same extent as a person that commits an unlawful act described in subsection (a) of that section.\n  (3) Exception relating to the importation of goods.\n    (A) In general. The requirement to block and prohibit all transactions in all property and interests in property under paragraph (1)(A) shall not include the authority to impose sanctions on the importation of goods.\n    (B) Good defined. In this paragraph, the term \u201cgood\u201d has the meaning given that term in section 4618 of title 50 (as continued in effect pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ( 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)).\n  (4) Exception to comply with United Nations headquarters agreement. Sanctions under paragraph (1)(B) shall not apply to an alien if admitting the alien into the United States is necessary to permit the United States to comply with the Agreement regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations, signed at Lake Success June 26, 1947, and entered into force November 21, 1947, between the United Nations and the United States, or other applicable international obligations.\n(c) Waiver. The President may waive the application of sanctions under subsection (b) with respect to a person if the President\u2014\n  (1) determines that such a waiver is in the national security interests of the United States; and\n  (2) on or before the date on which the waiver takes effect, submits to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives a notice of and a justification for the waiver.\n(d) Termination. Subject to section 9511 of this title, the President may terminate the application of sanctions under subsection (b) with respect to a person if the President submits to the appropriate congressional committees a notice that\u2014\n  (1) the person is not engaging in the activity that was the basis for the sanctions or has taken significant verifiable steps toward stopping the activity; and\n  (2) the President has received reliable assurances that the person will not knowingly engage in activity subject to sanctions under subsection (a) in the future.\n(e) Regulatory authority. The President shall issue such regulations, licenses, and orders as are necessary to carry out this section.\n\nWhat is the term defined at section 6041(b)(3) above?", "idx_line": 28, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 6041", "line_text": "\u00a7 6041.

Appropriate remedies with respect to prison conditions.\n(a) Requirements for Relief.\u2014\n  (1) Prospective relief.\u2014\n    (A) Prospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.\n    (B) The court shall not order any prospective relief that requires or permits a government official to exceed his or her authority under State or local law or otherwise violates State or local law, unless\u2014\n      (i) Federal law requires such relief to be ordered in violation of State or local law;\n      (ii) the relief is necessary to correct the violation of a Federal right; and\n      (iii) no other relief will correct the violation of the Federal right.\n    (C) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the courts, in exercising their remedial powers, to order the construction of prisons or the raising of taxes, or to repeal or detract from otherwise applicable limitations on the remedial powers of the courts.\n  (2) Preliminary injunctive relief.\u2014 In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, to the extent otherwise authorized by law, the court may enter a temporary restraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive relief. Preliminary injunctive relief must be narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the preliminary relief and shall respect the principles of comity set out in paragraph (1)(B) in tailoring any preliminary relief. Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on the date that is 90 days after its entry, unless the court makes the findings required under subsection (a)(1) for the entry of prospective relief and makes the order final before the expiration of the 90-day period.\n  (3) Prisoner release order.\u2014\n    (A) In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, no court shall enter a prisoner release order unless\u2014\n      (i) a court has previously entered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner release order; and\n      (ii) the defendant has had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous court orders.\n    (B) In any civil action in Federal court with respect to prison conditions, a prisoner release order shall be entered only by a three-judge court in accordance with section 2284 of title 28, if the requirements of subparagraph (E) have been met.\n    (C) A party seeking a prisoner release order in Federal court shall file with any request for such relief, a request for a three-judge court and materials sufficient to demonstrate that the requirements of subparagraph (A) have been met.\n    (D) If the requirements under subparagraph (A) have been met, a Federal judge before whom a civil action with respect to prison conditions is pending who believes that a prison release order should be considered may sua sponte request the convening of a three-judge court to determine whether a prisoner release order should be entered.\n    (E) The three-judge court shall enter a prisoner release order only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that\u2014\n      (i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right; and\n      (ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.\n    (F) Any State or local official including a legislator or unit of government whose jurisdiction or function includes the appropriation of funds for the construction, operation, or maintenance of prison facilities, or the prosecution or custody of persons who may be released from, or not admitted to, a prison as a result of a prisoner release order shall have standing to oppose the imposition or continuation in effect of such relief and to seek termination of such relief, and shall have the right to intervene in any proceeding relating to such relief.\n(b) Termination of Relief.\u2014\n  (1) Termination of prospective relief.\u2014\n    (A) In any civil action with respect to prison conditions in which prospective relief is ordered, such relief shall be terminable upon the motion of any party or intervener\u2014\n      (i) 2 years after the date the court granted or approved the prospective relief;\n      (ii) 1 year after the date the court has entered an order denying termination of prospective relief under this paragraph; or\n      (iii) in the case of an order issued on or before the date of enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 2 years after such date of enactment.\n    (B) Nothing in this section shall prevent the parties from agreeing to terminate or modify relief before the relief is terminated under subparagraph (A).\n  (2) Immediate termination of prospective relief.\u2014 In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, a defendant or intervener shall be entitled to the immediate termination of any prospective relief if the relief was approved or granted in the absence of a finding by the court that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\n  (3) Limitation.\u2014 Prospective relief shall not terminate if the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.\n  (4) Termination or modification of relief.\u2014 Nothing in this section shall prevent any party or intervener from seeking modification or termination before the relief is terminable under paragraph (1) or (2), to the extent that modification or termination would otherwise be legally permissible.\n(c) Settlements.\u2014\n  (1) Consent decrees.\u2014 In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, the court shall not enter or approve a consent decree unless it complies with the limitations on relief set forth in subsection (a).\n  (2) Private settlement agreements.\u2014\n    (A) Nothing in this section shall preclude parties from entering into a private settlement agreement that does not comply with the limitations on relief set forth in subsection (a), if the terms of that agreement are not subject to court enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the agreement settled.\n    (B) Nothing in this section shall preclude any party claiming that a private settlement agreement has been breached from seeking in State court any remedy available under State law.\n(d) State Law Remedies.\u2014 The limitations on remedies in this section shall not apply to relief entered by a State court based solely upon claims arising under State law.\n(e) Procedure for Motions Affecting Prospective Relief.\u2014\n  (1) Generally.\u2014 The court shall promptly rule on any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief in a civil action with respect to prison conditions. Mandamus shall lie to remedy any failure to issue a prompt ruling on such a motion.\n  (2) Automatic stay.\u2014 Any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief made under subsection (b) shall operate as a stay during the period\u2014\n    (A)\n      (i) beginning on the 30th day after such motion is filed, in the case of a motion made under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b); or\n      (ii) beginning on the 180th day after such motion is filed, in the case of a motion made under any other law; and\n    (B) ending on the date the court enters a final order ruling on the motion.\n  (3) Postponement of automatic stay.\u2014 The court may postpone the effective date of an automatic stay specified in subsection (e)(2)(A) for not more than 60 days for good cause. No postponement shall be permissible because of general congestion of the court\u2019s calendar.\n  (4) Order blocking the automatic stay.\u2014 Any order staying, suspending, delaying, or barring the operation of the automatic stay described in paragraph (2) (other than an order to postpone the effective date of the automatic stay under paragraph (3)) shall be treated as an order refusing to dissolve or modify an injunction and shall be appealable pursuant to section 1292(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, regardless of how the order is styled or whether the order is termed a preliminary or a final ruling.\n(f) Special Masters.\u2014\n  (1) In general.\u2014\n    (A) In any civil action in a Federal court with respect to prison conditions, the court may appoint a special master who shall be disinterested and objective and who will give due regard to the public safety, to conduct hearings on the record and prepare proposed findings of fact.\n    (B) The court shall appoint a special master under this subsection during the remedial phase of the action only upon a finding that the remedial phase will be sufficiently complex to warrant the appointment.\n  (2) Appointment.\u2014\n    (A) If the court determines that the appointment of a special master is necessary, the court shall request that the defendant institution and the plaintiff each submit a list of not more than 5 persons to serve as a special master.\n    (B) Each party shall have the opportunity to remove up to 3 persons from the opposing party\u2019s list.\n    (C) The court shall select the master from the persons remaining on the list after the operation of subparagraph (B).\n  (3) Interlocutory appeal.\u2014 Any party shall have the right to an interlocutory appeal of the judge\u2019s selection of the special master under this subsection, on the ground of partiality.\n  (4) Compensation.\u2014 The compensation to be allowed to a special master under this section shall be based on an hourly rate not greater than the hourly rate established under section 3006A for payment of court-appointed counsel, plus costs reasonably incurred by the special master. Such compensation and costs shall be paid with funds appropriated to the Judiciary.\n  (5) Regular review of appointment.\u2014 In any civil action with respect to prison conditions in which a special master is appointed under this subsection, the court shall review the appointment of the special master every 6 months to determine whether the services of the special master continue to be required under paragraph (1). In no event shall the appointment of a special master extend beyond the termination of the relief.\n  (6) Limitations on powers and duties.\u2014 A special master appointed under this subsection\u2014\n    (A) may be authorized by a court to conduct hearings and prepare proposed findings of fact, which shall be made on the record;\n    (B) shall not make any findings or communications ex parte;\n    (C) may be authorized by a court to assist in the development of remedial plans; and\n    (D) may be removed at any time, but shall be relieved of the appointment upon the termination of relief.\n(g) Definitions.\u2014 As used in this section\u2014\n  (1) the term \u201cconsent decree\u201d means any relief entered by the court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties but does not include private settlements;\n  (2) the term \u201ccivil action with respect to prison conditions\u201d means any civil proceeding arising under Federal law with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of persons confined in prison, but does not include habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact or duration of confinement in prison;\n  (3) the term \u201cprisoner\u201d means any person subject to incarceration, detention, or admission to any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program;\n  (4) the term \u201cprisoner release order\u201d includes any order, including a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief, that has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population, or that directs the release from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison;\n  (5) the term \u201cprison\u201d means any Federal, State, or local facility that incarcerates or detains juveniles or adults accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law;\n  (6) the term \u201cprivate settlement agreement\u201d means an agreement entered into among the parties that is not subject to judicial enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the agreement settled;\n  (7) the term \u201cprospective relief\u201d means all relief other than compensatory monetary damages;\n  (8) the term \u201cspecial master\u201d means any person appointed by a Federal court pursuant to Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or pursuant to any inherent power of the court to exercise the powers of a master, regardless of the title or description given by the court; and\n  (9) the term \u201crelief\u201d means all relief in any form that may be granted or approved by the court, and includes consent decrees but does not include private settlement agreements.\n\nWhat is the term defined at section 3626(g)(2) above?", "idx_line": 64, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 3626", "line_text": "\u00a7 3626.
