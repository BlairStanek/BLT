An election under this subsection may be made without the consent of the Secretary. Such an election, once made, shall apply to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary.\n(f) Election of mark to market for traders in securities or commodities.\n  (1) Traders in securities.\n    (A) In general. In the case of a person who is engaged in a trade or business as a trader in securities and who elects to have this paragraph apply to such trade or business\u2014\n      (i) such person shall recognize gain or loss on any security held in connection with such trade or business at the close of any taxable year as if such security were sold for its fair market value on the last business day of such taxable year, and\n      (ii) any gain or loss shall be taken into account for such taxable year.\n    Proper adjustment shall be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain or loss taken into account under the preceding sentence. The Secretary may provide by regulations for the application of this subparagraph at times other than the times provided in this subparagraph.\n    (B) Exception. Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any security\u2014\n      (i) which is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary as having no connection to the activities of such person as a trader, and\n      (ii) which is clearly identified in such person\u2019s records as being described in clause (i) before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into (or such other time as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe).\n    If a security ceases to be described in clause (i) at any time after it was identified as such under clause (ii), subparagraph (A) shall apply to any changes in value of the security occurring after the cessation.\n    (C) Coordination with section 1259. Any security to which subparagraph (A) applies and which was acquired in the normal course of the taxpayer\u2019s activities as a trader in securities shall not be taken into account in applying section 1259 to any position to which subparagraph (A) does not apply.\n    (D) Other rules to apply. Rules similar to the rules of subsections (b)(4) and (d) shall apply to securities held by a person in any trade or business with respect to which an election under this paragraph is in effect. Subsection (d)(3) shall not apply under the preceding sentence for purposes of applying sections 1402 and 7704.\n  (2) Traders in commodities. In the case of a person who is engaged in a trade or business as a trader in commodities and who elects to have this paragraph apply to such trade or business, paragraph (1) shall apply to commodities held by such trader in connection with such trade or business in the same manner as paragraph (1) applies to securities held by a trader in securities.\n  (3) Election. The elections under paragraphs (1) and (2) may be made separately for each trade or business and without the consent of the Secretary. Such an election, once made, shall apply to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary.\n(g) Regulatory authority. The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section, including rules\u2014\n  (1) to prevent the use of year-end transfers, related parties, or other arrangements to avoid the provisions of this section,\n  (2) to provide for the application of this section to any security which is a hedge which cannot be identified with a specific security, position, right to income, or liability, and\n  (3) to prevent the use by taxpayers of subsection (c)(4) to avoid the application of this section to a receivable that is inventory in the hands of the taxpayer (or a person who bears a relationship to the taxpayer described in section 267(b) or 707(b)).\n\nWhat is the exact text of just section 475(c)(1)(B) above?", "idx_line": 22, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 475", "line_text": "\u00a7 475.

Administration.\n(a) Authorities. The Secretary shall administer the Area in accordance with this part. Only those lands within the Area under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary shall be administered in accordance with the provisions of law generally applicable to units of the National Park System. Other lands and waters within the Area shall be administered under State and local laws.

The Secretary shall consult and cooperate with the State of Minnesota and its political subdivisions concerning the development and management of Federal lands within the Area.\n(c) Land acquisition. Within the boundaries of the Area, the Secretary is authorized, in consultation with the State of Minnesota and the affected local governmental unit, to acquire land and interests therein by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, exchange or transfer, except as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2).\n  (1) Any lands or interests therein owned by the State of Minnesota or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired only by donation.\n  (2) Privately owned lands or interests therein may be acquired only with the consent of the owner thereof unless the Secretary makes a determination pursuant to subsection (d)(2).

For the purpose of protecting the integrity of the Area the Secretary shall cooperate and consult with the State and the appropriate political subdivisions to review all relevant local plans, laws and ordinances to determine whether they substantially conform to the plan approved pursuant to section 460zz\u20132 of this title. Additionally the Secretary shall in consultation with the State and its political subdivisions determine the adequacy of enforcement of such plans, laws, and ordinances, including review of building permits and zoning variances granted by local governments, and amendments to local laws and ordinances. The Secretary shall enter into agreements with the State or its political subdivisions to provide, on behalf of the Secretary, professional services necessary for the review of such local plans, laws, and ordinances, and of amendments thereto and variances therefrom, and for the monitoring or the enforcement thereof by local governments having jurisdiction over any areas to which the management plan applies.\n  (2) Purpose. The purpose of review under paragraph (1) shall be to determine the degree to which actions by local governments are compatible with the purposes of this subchapter. Following the approval of the plan under section 460zz\u20132 of this title and after a reasonable period of time has elapsed, upon a finding by the Secretary that such plans, laws and ordinances are nonexistent, are otherwise not in conformance with the plan or are not being enforced in a manner consistent with the plan, and if the Secretary determines that there is no feasible alternative available to prevent uses which would be substantially incompatible with the plan, the Secretary may exercise the authority available to him under the provisions of paragraph (3).\n  (3) Enforcement. In those sections of the Area where local plans, laws and ordinances, or amendments thereto or variances therefrom are found by the Secretary not to be in conformance with the plan approved pursuant to section 460zz\u20132 of this title, or are not being enforced in a manner consistent with the plan, the Secretary shall notify the local government authority concerned. The Secretary may withhold from the local government authority concerned or, require reimbursement of, (A) Federal funds made available for implementation of the plan, or (B) any grant under section 460zz\u20135(a) of this title if the local plan, law, ordinance, amendment, or variance is not modified to conform with the plan and enforced in such manner as will carry out the purposes of this part. If the State has not initiated, within a 60-day period, such judicial or other action as necessary to ensure conformity with the plan, and if noncompliance with the plan or failure to enforce the plan continues after the end of such 60-day period, the Secretary may acquire, subject to appropriations, land or interests in land under this subsection without the consent of the owner thereof. Land and interests in land acquired pursuant to this subsection shall be restricted to the geographical area of the local government unit failing to conform with the plan and shall be limited to those lands clearly and directly required, in the judgment of the Secretary, for the protection of the Area in a manner compatible with the plan.\n(e) Retention by owner of use and occupancy. The Secretary may permit the owner or owners of any improved residential property acquired by the Secretary under this part to retain a right of use and occupancy of the property for noncommerical residential uses not incompatible with the plan approved under section 460zz\u20132 of this title. The provisions of subsection (c), (d), and (e) of section 460ii\u20131 of this title shall apply to the retention of such rights, except that for purposes of this part, the applicable date shall be January 1, 1987 in lieu of January 1, 1975 and the purposes of this part shall be substituted for the purposes referred to in section 460ii\u20131(d) of this title.\n\nWhat is the exact text of just section 1613(a) above?", "idx_line": 1, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 1613", "line_text": "\u00a7 1613.

Grants to centers for independent living in States in which State funding equals or exceeds Federal funding.\n(a) Establishment.\n  (1) In general.\n    (A) Initial year.\n      (i) Determination. The director of a designated State unit, as provided in paragraph (2), or the Administrator, as provided in paragraph (3), shall award grants under this section for an initial fiscal year if the Administrator determines that the amount of State funds that were earmarked by a State for a preceding fiscal year to support the general operation of centers for independent living meeting the requirements of this subpart equaled or exceeded the amount of funds allotted to the State under subsection (c) or (d) of section 796f of this title for such year.\n      (ii) Grants. The director of a designated State unit or the Administrator, as appropriate, shall award such grants, from the amount of funds so allotted for the initial fiscal year, to eligible agencies in the State for the planning, conduct, administration, and evaluation of centers for independent living that comply with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f\u20134 of this title.\n      (iii) Regulation. The Administrator shall by regulation specify the preceding fiscal year with respect to which the Administrator will make the determinations described in clause (i) and subparagraph (B), making such adjustments as may be necessary to accommodate State funding cycles such as 2-year funding cycles or State fiscal years that do not coincide with the Federal fiscal year.\n    (B) Subsequent years. For each year subsequent to the initial fiscal year described in subparagraph (A), the director of the designated State unit shall continue to have the authority to award such grants under this section if the Administrator determines that the State continues to earmark the amount of State funds described in subparagraph (A)(i). If the State does not continue to earmark such an amount for a fiscal year, the State shall be ineligible to make grants under this section after a final year following such fiscal year, as defined in accordance with regulations established by the Administrator, and for each subsequent fiscal year.\n  (2) Grants by designated State units. In order for the designated State unit to be eligible to award the grants described in paragraph (1) and carry out this section for a fiscal year with respect to a State, the designated State agency shall submit an application to the Administrator at such time, and in such manner as the Administrator may require, including information about the amount of State funds described in paragraph (1) for the preceding fiscal year.

In the administration of the provisions of this section, the director of the designated State unit shall award grants for a fiscal year under this section to any eligible agency that has been awarded a grant under this subpart for the preceding fiscal year, unless the director makes a finding that the agency involved fails to comply with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f\u20134 of this title.\n(d) New centers for independent living.\n  (1) In general. If there is no center for independent living serving a region of the State or the region is unserved or underserved, and the increase in the allotment of the State is sufficient to support an additional center for independent living in the State, the director of the designated State unit may award a grant under this section from among eligible agencies, consistent with the provisions of the State plan under section 796c of this title setting forth the design of the State for establishing a statewide network of centers for independent living.\n  (2) Selection. In selecting from among eligible agencies in awarding a grant under this subpart for a new center for independent living\u2014\n    (A) the director of the designated State unit and the chairperson of, or other individual designated by, the Statewide Independent Living Council acting on behalf of and at the direction of the Council, shall jointly appoint a peer review committee that shall rank applications in accordance with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f\u20134 of this title and criteria jointly established by such director and such chairperson or individual;\n    (B) the peer review committee shall consider the ability of each such applicant to operate a center for independent living, and shall recommend an applicant to receive a grant under this section, based on\u2014\n      (i) evidence of the need for a center for independent living, consistent with the State plan;\n      (ii) any past performance of such applicant in providing services comparable to independent living services;\n      (iii) the plan for complying with, or demonstrated success in complying with, the standards and the assurances set forth in section 796f\u20134 of this title;\n      (iv) the quality of key personnel of the applicant and the involvement of individuals with significant disabilities by the applicant;\n      (v) the budgets and cost-effectiveness of the applicant;\n      (vi) the evaluation plan of the applicant; and\n      (vii) the ability of such applicant to carry out the plans; and\n    (C) the director of the designated State unit shall award the grant on the basis of the recommendations of the peer review committee if the actions of the committee are consistent with Federal or State law.\n  (3) Current centers. Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), a center for independent living that receives assistance under subpart 2 for a fiscal year shall be eligible for a grant for the subsequent fiscal year under this subsection.\n(e) Order of priorities. Unless the director of the designated State unit and the chairperson of the Council or other individual designated by the Council acting on behalf of and at the direction of the Council jointly agree on another order of priority, the director shall be guided by the following order of priorities in allocating funds among centers for independent living within a State, to the extent funds are available:\n  (1) The director of the designated State unit shall support existing centers for independent living, as described in subsection (c), that comply with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f\u20134 of this title, at the level of funding for the previous year.\n  (2) The director of the designated State unit shall provide for a cost-of-living increase for such existing centers for independent living.\n  (3) The director of the designated State unit shall fund new centers for independent living, as described in subsection (d), that comply with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f\u20134 of this title.\n(f) Nonresidential agencies. A center that provides or manages residential housing after October 1, 1994, shall not be considered to be an eligible agency under this section.\n(g) Review.\n  (1) In general. The director of the designated State unit shall periodically review each center receiving funds under this section to determine whether such center is in compliance with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f\u20134 of this title.

The director of the designated State unit shall terminate all funds under this section to such center 90 days after\u2014\n    (A) the date of such notification; or\n    (B) in the case of a center that requests an appeal under subsection (i), the date of any final decision under subsection (i),\n  unless the center submits a plan to achieve compliance within 90 days and such plan is approved by the director, or if appealed, by the Administrator.\n(h) Onsite compliance review. The director of the designated State unit shall annually conduct onsite compliance reviews of at least 15 percent of the centers for independent living that receive funding under this section in the State. Each team that conducts onsite compliance review of centers for independent living shall include at least one person who is not an employee of the designated State agency, who has experience in the operation of centers for independent living, and who is jointly selected by the director of the designated State unit and the chairperson of or other individual designated by the Council acting on behalf of and at the direction of the Council.

Beginning on the date nine months after November 8, 1984, each application for a final determination regarding a permit under section 6925(c) of this title for a landfill or surface impoundment shall be accompanied by information reasonably ascertainable by the owner or operator on the potential for the public to be exposed to hazardous wastes or hazardous constituents through releases related to the unit. At a minimum, such information must address:\n  (1) reasonably foreseeable potential releases from both normal operations and accidents at the unit, including releases associated with transportation to or from the unit;\n  (2) the potential pathways of human exposure to hazardous wastes or constituents resulting from the releases described under paragraph (1); and\n  (3) the potential magnitude and nature of the human exposure resulting from such releases.\nThe owner or operator of a landfill or surface impoundment for which an application for such a final determination under section 6925(c) of this title has been submitted prior to November 8, 1984, shall submit the information required by this subsection to the Administrator (or the State, in the case of a State with an authorized program) no later than the date nine months after November 8, 1984.\n(b) Health assessments.\n  (1) The Administrator (or the State, in the case of a State with an authorized program) shall make the information required by subsection (a), together with other relevant information, available to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry established by section 9604(i) of this title.\n  (2) Whenever in the judgment of the Administrator, or the State (in the case of a State with an authorized program), a landfill or a surface impoundment poses a substantial potential risk to human health, due to the existence of releases of hazardous constituents, the magnitude of contamination with hazardous constituents which may be the result of a release, or the magnitude of the population exposed to such release or contamination, the Administrator or the State (with the concurrence of the Administrator) may request the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry to conduct a health assessment in connection with such facility and take other appropriate action with respect to such risks as authorized by section 9604(b) and (i) of this title. If funds are provided in connection with such request the Administrator of such Agency shall conduct such health assessment.\n(c) Members of the public. Any member of the public may submit evidence of releases of or exposure to hazardous constituents from such a facility, or as to the risks or health effects associated with such releases or exposure, to the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the Administrator, or the State (in the case of a State with an authorized program).\n(d) Priority. In determining the order in which to conduct health assessments under this subsection, the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry shall give priority to those facilities or sites at which there is documented evidence of release of hazardous constituents, at which the potential risk to human health appears highest, and for which in the judgment of the Administrator of such Agency existing health assessment data is inadequate to assess the potential risk to human health as provided in subsection (f).\n(e) Periodic reports. The Administrator of such Agency shall issue periodic reports which include the results of all the assessments carried out under this section. Such assessments or other activities shall be reported after appropriate peer review.\n(f) \u201cHealth assessments\u201d defined. For the purposes of this section, the term \u201chealth assessments\u201d shall include preliminary assessments of the potential risk to human health posed by individual sites and facilities subject to this section, based on such factors as the nature and extent of contamination, the existence of potential for pathways of human exposure (including ground or surface water contamination, air emissions, and food chain contamination), the size and potential susceptibility of the community within the likely pathways of exposure, the comparison of expected human exposure levels to the short-term and long-term health effects associated with identified contaminants and any available recommended exposure or tolerance limits for such contaminants, and the comparison of existing morbidity and mortality data on diseases that may be associated with the observed levels of exposure. The assessment shall include an evaluation of the risks to the potentially affected population from all sources of such contaminants, including known point or nonpoint sources other than the site or facility in question. A purpose of such preliminary assessments shall be to help determine whether full-scale health or epidemiological studies and medical evaluations of exposed populations shall be undertaken.\n(g) Cost recovery. In any case in which a health assessment performed under this section discloses the exposure of a population to the release of a hazardous substance, the costs of such health assessment may be recovered as a cost of response under section 9607 of this title from persons causing or contributing to such release of such hazardous substance or, in the case of multiple releases contributing to such exposure, to all such release.\n\n\u00a7 17092.

The purpose of this chapter is to insure that, because of the extensive governmental studies already made of this project and the national interest in early delivery of North Slope oil to domestic markets, the trans-Alaska oil pipeline be constructed promptly without further administrative or judicial delay or impediment. To accomplish this purpose it is the intent of the Congress to exercise its constitutional powers to the fullest extent in the authorizations and directions herein made and in limiting judicial review of the actions taken pursuant thereto.\n(b) Issuance, administration, and enforcement of rights-of-way, permits, leases, and other authorizations. The Congress hereby authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior and other appropriate Federal officers and agencies to issue and take all necessary action to administer and enforce rights-of-way, permits, leases, and other authorizations that are necessary for or related to the construction, operation, and maintenance of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline system, including roads and airstrips, as that system is generally described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement issued by the Department of the Interior on March 20, 1972. The route of the pipeline may be modified by the Secretary to provide during construction greater environmental protection.\n(c) Applicability of statutes governing rights-of-way for pipelines through Federal lands; other statutory terms and conditions; waiver of procedural requirements; supersedure of administrative authorizations for construction. Rights-of-way, permits, leases, and other authorizations issued pursuant to this chapter by the Secretary shall be subject to the provisions of section 185 of title 30, as amended by Pub. L. 93\u2013153 (except the provisions of subsections (h)(1), (k), (q), (w)(2), and (x)); all authorizations issued by the Secretary and other Federal officers and agencies pursuant to this chapter shall include the terms and conditions required, and may include the terms and conditions permitted, by the provisions of law that would otherwise be applicable if this chapter had not been enacted, and they may waive any procedural requirements of law or regulation which they deem desirable to waive in order to accomplish the purposes of this chapter. The direction contained in subsection (b) shall supersede the provisions of any law or regulation relating to an administrative determination as to whether the authorizations for construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline shall be issued.\n(d) National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 bypassed; issuance of authorizations for construction and operation not to be subject to judicial review; time limits on charges of invalidity or unconstitutionality; jurisdiction; hearings; review. The actions taken pursuant to this chapter which relate to the construction and completion of the pipeline system, and to the applications filed in connection therewith necessary to the pipeline\u2019s operation at full capacity, as described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement of the Department of the Interior, shall be taken without further action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.]; and the actions of the Federal officers concerning the issuance of the necessary rights-of-way, permits, leases, and other authorizations for construction and initial operation at full capacity of said pipeline system shall not be subject to judicial review under any law except that claims alleging the invalidity of this section may be brought within sixty days following November 16, 1973, and claims alleging that an action will deny rights under the Constitution of the United States, or that the action is beyond the scope of authority conferred by this chapter, may be brought within sixty days following the date of such action. A claim shall be barred unless a complaint is filed within the time specified. Any such complaint shall be filed in a United States district court, and such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine such proceeding in accordance with the procedures hereinafter provided, and no other court of the United States, of any State, territory, or possession of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, shall have jurisdiction of any such claim whether in a proceeding instituted prior to or on or after November 16, 1973. Such court shall not have jurisdiction to grant any injunctive relief against the issuance of any right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization pursuant to this section except in conjunction with a final judgment entered in a case involving a claim filed pursuant to this section. An interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of such district court may be reviewed only upon petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n(e) Amendment or modification of rights-of-way, permits, leases, or other authorizations. The Secretary of the Interior and the other Federal officers and agencies are authorized at any time when necessary to protect the public interest, pursuant to the authority of this section and in accordance with its provisions, to amend or modify any right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization issued under this chapter.\n\n\u00a7 1395w.

The Commodity Credit Corporation may sell any farm commodity owned or controlled by the Corporation at any price not prohibited by this section.\n(b) Inventories. In determining sales policies for basic agricultural commodities or storable nonbasic commodities, the Corporation should consider the establishment of such policies with respect to prices, terms, and conditions as the Corporation determines will not discourage or deter manufacturers, processors, and dealers from acquiring and carrying normal inventories of the commodity of the current crop.\n(c) Sales price restrictions.\n  (1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Corporation shall not sell any basic agricultural commodity or storable nonbasic commodity at less than 115 percent of the lower of\u2014\n    (A) the current national average price support loan rate for the commodity adjusted for the current market differentials reflecting grade, quality, location, reasonable carrying charges, and other factors determined appropriate by the Corporation; or\n    (B) the loan repayment level.\n  (2) Extra long staple cotton. The Corporation may sell extra long staple cotton for unrestricted use at such price as the Corporation determines is appropriate to maintain and expand export and domestic markets.\n  (3) Oilseeds.

The foregoing restrictions of this section shall not apply to\u2014\n  (1) sales for new or byproduct uses;\n  (2) sales of peanuts and oilseeds for the extraction of oil;\n  (3) sales for seed or feed if the sales will not substantially impair any price support program;\n  (4) sales of commodities that have substantially deteriorated in quality or as to which there is a danger of loss or waste through deterioration or spoilage;\n  (5) sales for the purpose of establishing claims arising out of contract or against persons who have committed fraud, misrepresentation, or other wrongful acts with respect to the commodity;\n  (6) sales for export (excluding sales of upland cotton for export);\n  (7) sales of wool; and\n  (8) sales for other than primary uses.\n(e) Distress, disaster, and livestock emergency areas.\n  (1) In general.

Subject to paragraph (2), the foregoing restrictions of this section shall not apply to sales of commodities the disposition of which is desirable in the interest of the effective and efficient conduct of the operations of the Corporation because of the small quantities involved, or because of age, location or questionable continued storability of the commodity.\n  (2) Offsets. The sales shall be offset (if necessary) by the purchases of commodities as the Corporation determines is appropriate to prevent the sales from substantially impairing any price support program or unduly affecting market prices, except that the purchase price shall not exceed the Corporation\u2019s minimum sales price for the commodities for unrestricted use.\n  (3) Competitive bid basis. Subject to the sales price restrictions contained in this section, the Corporation may sell any basic agricultural commodity or storable nonbasic commodity on a competitive bid basis, if the sale is determined to be appropriate by the Secretary.\n(g) Sales for export.

In any case in which an employer has completely or partially withdrawn from a multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the \u201cold plan\u201d) as a result of a certified change of collective bargaining representative occurring after September 25, 1980, if participants of the old plan who are employed by the employer will, as a result of that change, participate in another multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the \u201cnew plan\u201d), the old plan shall transfer assets and liabilities to the new plan in accordance with this section.\n(b) Notification by employer of plan sponsor of old plan; notification by plan sponsor of old plan of employer and plan sponsor of new plan; appeal by new plan to prevent transfer; further proceedings.\n  (1) The employer shall notify the plan sponsor of the old plan of a change in multiemployer plan participation described in subsection (a) no later than 30 days after the employer determines that the change will occur.\n  (2) The plan sponsor of the old plan shall\u2014\n    (A) notify the employer of\u2014\n      (i) the amount of the employer\u2019s withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the withdrawal,\n      (ii) the old plan\u2019s intent to transfer to the new plan the nonforfeitable benefits of the employees who are no longer working in covered service under the old plan as a result of the change of bargaining representative, and\n      (iii) the amount of assets and liabilities which are to be transferred to the new plan, and\n    (B) notify the plan sponsor of the new plan of the benefits, assets, and liabilities which will be transferred to the new plan.\n  (3) Within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(B), the new plan may file an appeal with the corporation to prevent the transfer. The transfer shall not be made if the corporation determines that the new plan would suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer. Upon notification described in paragraph (2), if\u2014\n    (A) the employer fails to object to the transfer within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(A), or\n    (B) the new plan either\u2014\n      (i) fails to file such an appeal, or\n      (ii) the corporation, pursuant to such an appeal, fails to find that the new plan would suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer described in the notice under paragraph (2)(B) within 180 days after the date on which the appeal is filed,\n  then the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities to the new plan.\n(c) Reduction of amount of withdrawal liability of employer upon transfer of appropriate amount of assets and liabilities by plan sponsor of old plan to new plan. If the plan sponsor of the old plan transfers the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities under this section to the new plan, then the amount of the employer\u2019s withdrawal liability (as determined under section 1381(b) of this title without regard to such transfer and this section) with respect to the old plan shall be reduced by the amount by which\u2014\n  (1) the value of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer which were transferred by the plan sponsor of the old plan to the new plan, exceeds\n  (2) the value of the assets transferred.\n(d) Escrow payments by employer upon complete or partial withdrawal and prior to transfer. In any case in which there is a complete or partial withdrawal described in subsection (a), if\u2014\n  (1) the new plan files an appeal with the corporation under subsection (b)(3), and\n  (2) the employer is required by section 1399 of this title to begin making payments of withdrawal liability before the earlier of\u2014\n    (A) the date on which the corporation finds that the new plan would not suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer, or\n    (B) the last day of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the new plan files its appeal,\nthen the employer shall make such payments into an escrow held by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the old plan. If the transfer is made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be returned to the employer. If the transfer is not made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be paid to the old plan and credited against the employer\u2019s withdrawal liability.\n(e) Prohibition on transfer of assets to new plan by plan sponsor of old plan; exemptions.\n  (1) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the plan sponsor shall not transfer any assets to the new plan if\u2014\n    (A) the old plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) of this title), or\n    (B) the transfer of assets would cause the old plan to go into reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) 1 of this title).\n  (2) In any case in which a transfer of assets from the old plan to the new plan is prohibited by paragraph (1), the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer\u2014\n    (A) all nonforfeitable benefits described in subsection (b)(2), if the value of such benefits does not exceed the withdrawal liability of the employer with respect to such withdrawal, or\n    (B) such nonforfeitable benefits having a value equal to the withdrawal liability of the employer, if the value of such benefits exceeds the withdrawal liability of the employer.\n(f) Agreement between plan sponsors of old plan and new plan to transfer in compliance with other statutory provisions; reduction of withdrawal liability of employer from old plan; amount of withdrawal liability of employer to new plan.\n  (1) Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (e), the plan sponsors of the old plan and the new plan may agree to a transfer of assets and liabilities that complies with sections 1411 and 1414 of this title, rather than this section, except that the employer\u2019s liability with respect to the withdrawal from the old plan shall be reduced under subsection (c) as if assets and liabilities had been transferred in accordance with this section.\n  (2) If the employer withdraws from the new plan within 240 months after the effective date of a transfer of assets and liabilities described in this section, the amount of the employer\u2019s withdrawal liability to the new plan shall be the greater of\u2014\n    (A) the employer\u2019s withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the new plan, or\n    (B) the amount by which the employer\u2019s withdrawal liability to the old plan was reduced under subsection (c), reduced by 5 percent for each 12-month period following the effective date of the transfer and ending before the date of the withdrawal from the new plan.\n(g) Definitions.

Standards.\n(a) Promulgation by Secretary of national consensus standards and established Federal standards; time for promulgation; conflicting standards. Without regard to chapter 5 of title 5 or to the other subsections of this section, the Secretary shall, as soon as practicable during the period beginning with the effective date of this chapter and ending two years after such date, by rule promulgate as an occupational safety or health standard any national consensus standard, and any established Federal standard, unless he determines that the promulgation of such a standard would not result in improved safety or health for specifically designated employees. In the event of conflict among any such standards, the Secretary shall promulgate the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees.\n(b) Procedure for promulgation, modification, or revocation of standards. The Secretary may by rule promulgate, modify, or revoke any occupational safety or health standard in the following manner:\n  (1) Whenever the Secretary, upon the basis of information submitted to him in writing by an interested person, a representative of any organization of employers or employees, a nationally recognized standards-producing organization, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or a State or political subdivision, or on the basis of information developed by the Secretary or otherwise available to him, determines that a rule should be promulgated in order to serve the objectives of this chapter, the Secretary may request the recommendations of an advisory committee appointed under section 656 of this title. The Secretary shall provide such an advisory committee with any proposals of his own or of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, together with all pertinent factual information developed by the Secretary or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or otherwise available, including the results of research, demonstrations, and experiments. An advisory committee shall submit to the Secretary its recommendations regarding the rule to be promulgated within ninety days from the date of its appointment or within such longer or shorter period as may be prescribed by the Secretary, but in no event for a period which is longer than two hundred and seventy days.\n  (2) The Secretary shall publish a proposed rule promulgating, modifying, or revoking an occupational safety or health standard in the Federal Register and shall afford interested persons a period of thirty days after publication to submit written data or comments. Where an advisory committee is appointed and the Secretary determines that a rule should be issued, he shall publish the proposed rule within sixty days after the submission of the advisory committee\u2019s recommendations or the expiration of the period prescribed by the Secretary for such submission.\n  (3) On or before the last day of the period provided for the submission of written data or comments under paragraph (2), any interested person may file with the Secretary written objections to the proposed rule, stating the grounds therefor and requesting a public hearing on such objections. Within thirty days after the last day for filing such objections, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice specifying the occupational safety or health standard to which objections have been filed and a hearing requested, and specifying a time and place for such hearing.\n  (4) Within sixty days after the expiration of the period provided for the submission of written data or comments under paragraph (2), or within sixty days after the completion of any hearing held under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall issue a rule promulgating, modifying, or revoking an occupational safety or health standard or make a determination that a rule should not be issued. Such a rule may contain a provision delaying its effective date for such period (not in excess of ninety days) as the Secretary determines may be necessary to insure that affected employers and employees will be informed of the existence of the standard and of its terms and that employers affected are given an opportunity to familiarize themselves and their employees with the existence of the requirements of the standard.\n  (5) The Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life. Development of standards under this subsection shall be based upon research, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as may be appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the standards, and experience gained under this and other health and safety laws. Whenever practicable, the standard promulgated shall be expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired.\n  (6)\n    (A) Any employer may apply to the Secretary for a temporary order granting a variance from a standard or any provision thereof promulgated under this section. Such temporary order shall be granted only if the employer files an application which meets the requirements of clause (B) and establishes that (i) he is unable to comply with a standard by its effective date because of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment needed to come into compliance with the standard or because necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date, (ii) he is taking all available steps to safeguard his employees against the hazards covered by the standard, and (iii) he has an effective program for coming into compliance with the standard as quickly as practicable. Any temporary order issued under this paragraph shall prescribe the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which the employer must adopt and use while the order is in effect and state in detail his program for coming into compliance with the standard. Such a temporary order may be granted only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a hearing: Provided, That the Secretary may issue one interim order to be effective until a decision is made on the basis of the hearing. No temporary order may be in effect for longer than the period needed by the employer to achieve compliance with the standard or one year, whichever is shorter, except that such an order may be renewed not more than twice (I) so long as the requirements of this paragraph are met and (II) if an application for renewal is filed at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the order. No interim renewal of an order may remain in effect for longer than 180 days.\n    (B) An application for a temporary order under this paragraph (6) shall contain:\n      (i) a specification of the standard or portion thereof from which the employer seeks a variance,\n      (ii) a representation by the employer, supported by representations from qualified persons having firsthand knowledge of the facts represented, that he is unable to comply with the standard or portion thereof and a detailed statement of the reasons therefor,\n      (iii) a statement of the steps he has taken and will take (with specific dates) to protect employees against the hazard covered by the standard,\n      (iv) a statement of when he expects to be able to comply with the standard and what steps he has taken and what steps he will take (with dates specified) to come into compliance with the standard, and\n      (v) a certification that he has informed his employees of the application by giving a copy thereof to their authorized representative, posting a statement giving a summary of the application and specifying where a copy may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees are normally posted, and by other appropriate means.\n    A description of how employees have been informed shall be contained in the certification. The information to employees shall also inform them of their right to petition the Secretary for a hearing.\n    (C) The Secretary is authorized to grant a variance from any standard or portion thereof whenever he determines, or the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies, that such variance is necessary to permit an employer to participate in an experiment approved by him or the Secretary of Health and Human Services designed to demonstrate or validate new and improved techniques to safeguard the health and safety of workers.\n  (7) Any standard promulgated under this subsection shall prescribe the use of labels or other appropriate forms of warning as are necessary to insure that employees are apprised of all hazards to which they are exposed, relevant symptoms and appropriate emergency treatment, and proper conditions and precautions of safe use or exposure. Where appropriate, such standard shall also prescribe suitable protective equipment and control or technological procedures to be used in connection with such hazards and shall provide for monitoring or measuring employee exposure at such locations and intervals, and in such manner as may be necessary for the protection of employees. In addition, where appropriate, any such standard shall prescribe the type and frequency of medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available, by the employer or at his cost, to employees exposed to such hazards in order to most effectively determine whether the health of such employees is adversely affected by such exposure. In the event such medical examinations are in the nature of research, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, such examinations may be furnished at the expense of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The results of such examinations or tests shall be furnished only to the Secretary or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and, at the request of the employee, to his physician. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, may by rule promulgated pursuant to section 553 of title 5, make appropriate modifications in the foregoing requirements relating to the use of labels or other forms of warning, monitoring or measuring, and medical examinations, as may be warranted by experience, information, or medical or technological developments acquired subsequent to the promulgation of the relevant standard.\n  (8) Whenever a rule promulgated by the Secretary differs substantially from an existing national consensus standard, the Secretary shall, at the same time, publish in the Federal Register a statement of the reasons why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this chapter than the national consensus standard.\n(c) Emergency temporary standards.\n  (1) The Secretary shall provide, without regard to the requirements of chapter 5 of title 5, for an emergency temporary standard to take immediate effect upon publication in the Federal Register if he determines (A) that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards, and (B) that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.\n  (2) Such standard shall be effective until superseded by a standard promulgated in accordance with the procedures prescribed in paragraph (3) of this subsection.\n  (3) Upon publication of such standard in the Federal Register the Secretary shall commence a proceeding in accordance with subsection (b), and the standard as published shall also serve as a proposed rule for the proceeding. The Secretary shall promulgate a standard under this paragraph no later than six months after publication of the emergency standard as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n(d) Variances from standards; procedure. Any affected employer may apply to the Secretary for a rule or order for a variance from a standard promulgated under this section. Affected employees shall be given notice of each such application and an opportunity to participate in a hearing. The Secretary shall issue such rule or order if he determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate and a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or processes used or proposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and places of employment to his employees which are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail if he complied with the standard. The rule or order so issued shall prescribe the conditions the employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which he must adopt and utilize to the extent they differ from the standard in question. Such a rule or order may be modified or revoked upon application by an employer, employees, or by the Secretary on his own motion, in the manner prescribed for its issuance under this subsection at any time after six months from its issuance.\n(e) Statement of reasons for Secretary\u2019s determinations; publication in Federal Register. Whenever the Secretary promulgates any standard, makes any rule, order, or decision, grants any exemption or extension of time, or compromises, mitigates, or settles any penalty assessed under this chapter, he shall include a statement of the reasons for such action, which shall be published in the Federal Register.\n(f) Judicial review. Any person who may be adversely affected by a standard issued under this section may at any time prior to the sixtieth day after such standard is promulgated file a petition challenging the validity of such standard with the United States court of appeals for the circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, for a judicial review of such standard. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The filing of such petition shall not, unless otherwise ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the standard. The determinations of the Secretary shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\n(g) Priority for establishment of standards. In determining the priority for establishing standards under this section, the Secretary shall give due regard to the urgency of the need for mandatory safety and health standards for particular industries, trades, crafts, occupations, businesses, workplaces or work environments. The Secretary shall also give due regard to the recommendations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding the need for mandatory standards in determining the priority for establishing such standards.\n\nWhat is the exact text of just section 655(b)(6)(C) above?", "idx_line": 17, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 655", "line_text": "\u00a7 655.

Subject to subsection (b), Federal credit union membership shall consist of the incorporators and such other persons and incorporated and unincorporated organizations, to the extent permitted by rules and regulations prescribed by the Board, as may be elected to membership and as such shall each, subscribe to at least one share of its stock and pay the initial installment thereon and a uniform entrance fee if required by the board of directors. Shares may be issued in joint tenancy with right of survivorship with any persons designated by the credit union member, but no joint tenant shall be permitted to vote, obtain loans, or hold office, unless he is within the field of membership and is a qualified member.\n(b) Membership field. Subject to the other provisions of this section, the membership of any Federal credit union shall be limited to the membership described in one of the following categories:\n  (1) Single common-bond credit union. One group that has a common bond of occupation or association.\n  (2) Multiple common-bond credit union. More than one group\u2014\n    (A) each of which has (within the group) a common bond of occupation or association; and\n    (B) the number of members, each of which (at the time the group is first included within the field of membership of a credit union described in this paragraph) does not exceed any numerical limitation applicable under subsection (d).\n  (3) Community credit union. Persons or organizations within a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district.\n(c) Exceptions.\n  (1) Grandfathered members and groups.\n    (A) In general. Notwithstanding subsection (b)\u2014\n      (i) any person or organization that is a member of any Federal credit union as of August 7, 1998, may remain a member of the credit union after August 7, 1998; and\n      (ii) a member of any group whose members constituted a portion of the membership of any Federal credit union as of August 7, 1998, shall continue to be eligible to become a member of that credit union, by virtue of membership in that group, after August 7, 1998.\n    (B) Successors. If the common bond of any group referred to in subparagraph (A) is defined by any particular organization or business entity, subparagraph (A) shall continue to apply with respect to any successor to the organization or entity.\n  (2) Exception for underserved areas. Notwithstanding subsection (b), in the case of a Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2), the Board may allow the membership of the credit union to include any person or organization within a local community, neighborhood, or rural district if\u2014\n    (A) the Board determines that the local community, neighborhood, or rural district\u2014\n      (i) is an \u201cinvestment area\u201d, as defined in section 4702(16) of this title, and meets such additional requirements as the Board may impose; and\n      (ii) is underserved, based on data of the Board and the Federal banking agencies (as defined in section 1813 of this title), by other depository institutions (as defined in section 461(b)(1)(A) of this title); and\n    (B) the credit union establishes and maintains an office or facility in the local community, neighborhood, or rural district at which credit union services are available.\n(d) Multiple common-bond credit union group requirements.\n  (1) Numerical limitation. Except as provided in paragraph (2), only a group with fewer than 3,000 members shall be eligible to be included in the field of membership category of a credit union described in subsection (b)(2).\n  (2) Exceptions. In the case of any Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2), the numerical limitation in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to\u2014\n    (A) any group that the Board determines, in writing and in accordance with the guidelines and regulations issued under paragraph (3), could not feasibly or reasonably establish a new single common-bond credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(1) because\u2014\n      (i) the group lacks sufficient volunteer and other resources to support the efficient and effective operation of a credit union;\n      (ii) the group does not meet the criteria that the Board has determined to be important for the likelihood of success in establishing and managing a new credit union, including demographic characteristics such as geographical location of members, diversity of ages and income levels, and other factors that may affect the financial viability or stability of a credit union; or\n      (iii) the group would be unlikely to operate a safe and sound credit union;\n    (B) any group transferred from another credit union\u2014\n      (i) in connection with a merger or consolidation recommended by the Board or any appropriate State credit union supervisor based on safety and soundness concerns with respect to that other credit union; or\n      (ii) by the Board in the Board\u2019s capacity as conservator or liquidating agent with respect to that other credit union; or\n    (C) any group transferred in connection with a voluntary merger, having received conditional approval by the Administration of the merger application prior to October 25, 1996, but not having consummated the merger prior to October 25, 1996, if the merger is consummated not later than 180 days after August 7, 1998.\n  (3) Regulations and guidelines. The Board shall issue guidelines or regulations, after notice and opportunity for comment, setting forth the criteria that the Board will apply in determining under this subsection whether or not an additional group may be included within the field of membership category of an existing credit union described in subsection (b)(2).\n(e) Additional membership eligibility provisions.\n  (1) Membership eligibility limited to immediate family or household members. No individual shall be eligible for membership in a credit union on the basis of the relationship of the individual to another person who is eligible for membership in the credit union, unless the individual is a member of the immediate family or household (as those terms are defined by the Board, by regulation) of the other person.\n  (2) Retention of membership. Except as provided in section 1764 of this title, once a person becomes a member of a credit union in accordance with this subchapter, that person or organization may remain a member of that credit union until the person or organization chooses to withdraw from the membership of the credit union.\n(f) Criteria for approval of expansion of multiple common-bond credit unions.\n  (1) In general. The Board shall\u2014\n    (A) encourage the formation of separately chartered credit unions instead of approving an application to include an additional group within the field of membership of an existing credit union whenever practicable and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of the credit union; and\n    (B) if the formation of a separate credit union by the group is not practicable or consistent with the standards referred to in subparagraph (A), require the inclusion of the group in the field of membership of a credit union that is within reasonable proximity to the location of the group whenever practicable and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of the credit union.\n  (2) Approval criteria. The Board may not approve any application by a Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2) to include any additional group within the field of membership of the credit union (or an application by a Federal credit union described in subsection (b)(1) to include an additional group and become a credit union described in subsection (b)(2)), unless the Board determines, in writing, that\u2014\n    (A) the credit union has not engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice (as defined in section 1786(b) of this title) that is material during the 1-year period preceding the date of filing of the application;\n    (B) the credit union is adequately capitalized;\n    (C) the credit union has the administrative capability to serve the proposed membership group and the financial resources to meet the need for additional staff and assets to serve the new membership group;\n    (D) any potential harm that the expansion of the field of membership of the credit union may have on any other insured credit union and its members is clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable beneficial effect of the expansion in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group proposed to be included in the field of membership; and\n    (E) the credit union has met such additional requirements as the Board may prescribe, by regulation.\n(g) Regulations required for community credit unions.\n  (1) Definition of well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district. The Board shall prescribe, by regulation, a definition for the term \u201cwell-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district\u201d for purposes of\u2014\n    (A) making any determination with regard to the field of membership of a credit union described in subsection (b)(3); and\n    (B) establishing the criteria applicable with respect to any such determination.\n  (2) Scope of application. The definition prescribed by the Board under paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any application to form a new credit union, or to alter or expand the field of membership of an existing credit union, that is filed with the Board after August 7, 1998.\n\nWhat is the exact text of just section 1759(d)(2)(A)(ii) above?", "idx_line": 24, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 1759", "line_text": "\u00a7 1759.

Any State which desires to do so may enter into and participate in an agreement under this section with the Secretary of Labor (in this section referred to as the \u201cSecretary\u201d). Any State which is a party to an agreement under this section may, upon providing 30 days\u2019 written notice to the Secretary, terminate such agreement.\n(b) Provisions of agreement.\n  (1) Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation. Any agreement under this section shall provide that the State agency of the State will make payments of regular compensation to individuals in amounts and to the extent that they would be determined if the State law of the State were applied, with respect to any week for which the individual is (disregarding this section) otherwise entitled under the State law to receive regular compensation, as if such State law had been modified in a manner such that the amount of regular compensation (including dependents\u2019 allowances) payable for any week shall be equal to\u2014\n    (A) the amount determined under the State law (before the application of this paragraph), plus\n    (B) an additional amount equal to the amount specified in paragraph (3) (in this section referred to as \u201cFederal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation\u201d), plus\n    (C) an additional amount of $100 (in this section referred to as \u201cMixed Earner Unemployment Compensation\u201d) in any case in which the individual received at least $5,000 of self-employment income (as defined in section 1402(b) of title 26) in the most recent taxable year ending prior to the individual\u2019s application for regular compensation.\n  (2) Allowable methods of payment. Any Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation provided for in accordance with paragraph (1) shall be payable either\u2014\n    (A) as an amount which is paid at the same time and in the same manner as any regular compensation otherwise payable for the week involved; or\n    (B) at the option of the State, by payments which are made separately from, but on the same weekly basis as, any regular compensation otherwise payable.\n  (3) Amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation.\n    (A) In general . The amount specified in this paragraph is the following amount:\n      (i) For weeks of unemployment beginning after the date on which an agreement is entered into under this section and ending on or before July 31, 2020, $600.\n      (ii) For weeks of unemployment beginning after December 26, 2020 (or, if later, the date on which such agreement is entered into), and ending on or before September 6, 2021, $300.\n  (4) Certain documentation required. An agreement under this section shall include a requirement, similar to the requirement under section 9021(a)(3)(A)(iii) of this title, for the substantiation of self-employment income with respect to each applicant for Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation under paragraph (1)(C).\n(c) Nonreduction rule.\n  (1) In general. An agreement under this section shall not apply (or shall cease to apply) with respect to a State upon a determination by the Secretary that the method governing the computation of regular compensation under the State law of that State has been modified in a manner such that the number of weeks (the maximum benefit entitlement), or the average weekly benefit amount, of regular compensation which will be payable during the period of the agreement (determined disregarding any Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation) will be less than the number of weeks, or the average weekly benefit amount, of the average weekly benefit amount of regular compensation which would otherwise have been payable during such period under the State law, as in effect on January 1, 2020.\n  (2) Maximum benefit entitlement. In paragraph (1), the term \u201cmaximum benefit entitlement\u201d means the amount of regular unemployment compensation payable to an individual with respect to the individual\u2019s benefit year.\n(d) Payments to States.\n  (1) In general.\n    (A) Full reimbursement. There shall be paid to each State which has entered into an agreement under this section an amount equal to 100 percent of\u2014\n      (i) the total amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation and Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation paid to individuals by the State pursuant to such agreement; and\n      (ii) unless otherwise provided by section 101, any additional administrative expenses incurred by the State by reason of such agreement (as determined by the Secretary).\n    (B) Terms of payments. Sums payable to any State by reason of such State\u2019s having an agreement under this section shall be payable, either in advance or by way of reimbursement (as determined by the Secretary), in such amounts as the Secretary estimates the State will be entitled to receive under this section for each calendar month, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any amount by which the Secretary finds that his estimates for any prior calendar month were greater or less than the amounts which should have been paid to the State. Such estimates may be made on the basis of such statistical, sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency of the State involved.\n  (2) Certifications. The Secretary shall from time to time certify to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment to each State the sums payable to such State under this section.\n  (3) Appropriation. There are appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury, without fiscal year limitation, such sums as may be necessary for purposes of this subsection.\n(e) Applicability. An agreement entered into under this section shall apply\u2014\n  (1) to weeks of unemployment beginning after the date on which such agreement is entered into and ending on or before July 31, 2020; and\n  (2) to weeks of unemployment beginning after December 26, 2020 (or, if later, the date on which such agreement is entered into), and ending on or before September 6, 2021.\n(f) Fraud and overpayments.\n  (1) In general. If an individual knowingly has made, or caused to be made by another, a false statement or representation of a material fact, or knowingly has failed, or caused another to fail, to disclose a material fact, and as a result of such false statement or representation or of such nondisclosure such individual has received an amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation to which such individual was not entitled, such individual\u2014\n    (A) shall be ineligible for further Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation in accordance with the provisions of the applicable State unemployment compensation law relating to fraud in connection with a claim for unemployment compensation; and\n    (B) shall be subject to prosecution under section 1001 of title 18.\n  (2) Repayment. In the case of individuals who have received amounts of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation to which they were not entitled, the State shall require such individuals to repay the amounts of such Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation to the State agency, except that the State agency may waive such repayment if it determines that\u2014\n    (A) the payment of such Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation was without fault on the part of any such individual; and\n    (B) such repayment would be contrary to equity and good conscience.\n  (3) Recovery by State agency.\n    (A) In general. The State agency shall recover the amount to be repaid, or any part thereof, by deductions from any Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation payable to such individual or from any unemployment compensation payable to such individual under any State or Federal unemployment compensation law administered by the State agency or under any other State or Federal law administered by the State agency which provides for the payment of any assistance or allowance with respect to any week of unemployment, during the 3-year period after the date such individuals received the payment of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation to which they were not entitled, in accordance with the same procedures as apply to the recovery of overpayments of regular unemployment benefits paid by the State.\n    (B) Opportunity for hearing. No repayment shall be required, and no deduction shall be made, until a determination has been made, notice thereof and an opportunity for a fair hearing has been given to the individual, and the determination has become final.\n  (4) Review. Any determination by a State agency under this section shall be subject to review in the same manner and to the same extent as determinations under the State unemployment compensation law, and only in that manner and to that extent.\n(g) Application to other unemployment benefits.

This section applies to any civil action or proceeding, including any child custody proceeding, in which the defendant does not make an appearance.\n(b) Affidavit requirement.\n  (1) Plaintiff to file affidavit. In any action or proceeding covered by this section, the court, before entering judgment for the plaintiff, shall require the plaintiff to file with the court an affidavit\u2014\n    (A) stating whether or not the defendant is in military service and showing necessary facts to support the affidavit; or\n    (B) if the plaintiff is unable to determine whether or not the defendant is in military service, stating that the plaintiff is unable to determine whether or not the defendant is in military service.\n  (2) Appointment of attorney to represent defendant in military service. If in an action covered by this section it appears that the defendant is in military service, the court may not enter a judgment until after the court appoints an attorney to represent the defendant. If an attorney appointed under this section to represent a servicemember cannot locate the servicemember, actions by the attorney in the case shall not waive any defense of the servicemember or otherwise bind the servicemember.\n  (3) Defendant\u2019s military status not ascertained by affidavit. If based upon the affidavits filed in such an action, the court is unable to determine whether the defendant is in military service, the court, before entering judgment, may require the plaintiff to file a bond in an amount approved by the court. If the defendant is later found to be in military service, the bond shall be available to indemnify the defendant against any loss or damage the defendant may suffer by reason of any judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant, should the judgment be set aside in whole or in part. The bond shall remain in effect until expiration of the time for appeal and setting aside of a judgment under applicable Federal or State law or regulation or under any applicable ordinance of a political subdivision of a State. The court may issue such orders or enter such judgments as the court determines necessary to protect the rights of the defendant under this chapter.\n  (4) Satisfaction of requirement for affidavit. The requirement for an affidavit under paragraph (1) may be satisfied by a statement, declaration, verification, or certificate, in writing, subscribed and certified or declared to be true under penalty of perjury.\n(c) Penalty for making or using false affidavit. A person who makes or uses an affidavit permitted under subsection (b) (or a statement, declaration, verification, or certificate as authorized under subsection (b)(4)) knowing it to be false, shall be fined as provided in title 18, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\n(d) Stay of proceedings. In an action covered by this section in which the defendant is in military service, the court shall grant a stay of proceedings for a minimum period of 90 days under this subsection upon application of counsel, or on the court\u2019s own motion, if the court determines that\u2014\n  (1) there may be a defense to the action and a defense cannot be presented without the presence of the defendant; or\n  (2) after due diligence, counsel has been unable to contact the defendant or otherwise determine if a meritorious defense exists.\n(e) Inapplicability of section 3932 procedures. A stay of proceedings under subsection (d) shall not be controlled by procedures or requirements under section 3932 of this title.\n(f) Section 3932 protection. If a servicemember who is a defendant in an action covered by this section receives actual notice of the action, the servicemember may request a stay of proceeding under section 3932 of this title.\n(g) Vacation or setting aside of default judgments.\n  (1) Authority for court to vacate or set aside judgment. If a default judgment is entered in an action covered by this section against a servicemember during the servicemember\u2019s period of military service (or within 60 days after termination of or release from such military service), the court entering the judgment shall, upon application by or on behalf of the servicemember, reopen the judgment for the purpose of allowing the servicemember to defend the action if it appears that\u2014\n    (A) the servicemember was materially affected by reason of that military service in making a defense to the action; and\n    (B) the servicemember has a meritorious or legal defense to the action or some part of it.\n  (2) Time for filing application. An application under this subsection must be filed not later than 90 days after the date of the termination of or release from military service.\n(h) Protection of bona fide purchaser. If a court vacates, sets aside, or reverses a default judgment against a servicemember and the vacating, setting aside, or reversing is because of a provision of this chapter, that action shall not impair a right or title acquired by a bona fide purchaser for value under the default judgment.\n\nWhat is the exact text of just section 941c(e)(2)(B)(ii)(II)(bb) above?", "idx_line": 57, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 941c", "line_text": "\u00a7 941c.

Findings .\nCongress makes the following findings:\n(1) According to the Department of State, the Government of North Korea is \u201ca dictatorship under the absolute rule of Kim Jong Il\u201d that continues to commit numerous, serious human rights abuses.\n(2) The Government of North Korea attempts to control all information, artistic expression, academic works, and media activity inside North Korea and strictly curtails freedom of speech and access to foreign broadcasts.\n(3) The Government of North Korea subjects all its citizens to systematic, intensive political and ideological indoctrination in support of the cult of personality glorifying Kim Jong Il and the late Kim Il Sung that approaches the level of a state religion.\n(4) The Government of North Korea divides its population into categories, based on perceived loyalty to the leadership, which determines access to food, employment, higher education, place of residence, medical facilities, and other resources.\n(5) According to the Department of State, \u201c[t]he [North Korean] Penal Code is [d]raconian, stipulating capital punishment and confiscation of assets for a wide variety of \u2018crimes against the revolution,\u2019 including defection, attempted defection, slander of the policies of the Party or State, listening to foreign broadcasts, writing \u2018reactionary\u2019 letters, and possessing reactionary printed matter\u201d.\n(6) The Government of North Korea executes political prisoners, opponents of the regime, some repatriated defectors, some members of underground churches, and others, sometimes at public meetings attended by workers, students, and schoolchildren.\n(7) The Government of North Korea holds an estimated 200,000 political prisoners in camps that its State Security Agency manages through the use of forced labor, beatings, torture, and executions, and in which many prisoners also die from disease, starvation, and exposure.\n(8) According to eyewitness testimony provided to the United States Congress by North Korean camp survivors, camp inmates have been used as sources of slave labor for the production of export goods, as targets for martial arts practice, and as experimental victims in the testing of chemical and biological poisons.\n(9) According to credible reports, including eyewitness testimony provided to the United States Congress, North Korean Government officials prohibit live births in prison camps, and forced abortion and the killing of newborn babies are standard prison practices.\n(10) According to the Department of State, \u201c[g]enuine religious freedom does not exist in North Korea\u201d and, according to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, \u201c[t]he North Korean state severely represses public and private religious activities\u201d with penalties that reportedly include arrest, imprisonment, torture, and sometimes execution.\n(11) More than 2,000,000 North Koreans are estimated to have died of starvation since the early 1990s because of the failure of the centralized agricultural and public distribution systems operated by the Government of North Korea.\n(12) According to a 2002 United Nations-European Union survey, nearly one out of every ten children in North Korea suffers from acute malnutrition and four out of every ten children in North Korea are chronically malnourished.\n(13) Since 1995, the United States has provided more than 2,000,000 tons of humanitarian food assistance to the people of North Korea, primarily through the World Food Program.\n(14) Although United States food assistance has undoubtedly saved many North Korean lives and there have been minor improvements in transparency relating to the distribution of such assistance in North Korea, the Government of North Korea continues to deny the World Food Program forms of access necessary to properly monitor the delivery of food aid, including the ability to conduct random site visits, the use of native Korean-speaking employees, and travel access throughout North Korea.\n(15) The risk of starvation, the threat of persecution, and the lack of freedom and opportunity in North Korea have caused large numbers, perhaps even hundreds of thousands, of North Koreans to flee their homeland, primarily into China.\n(16) North Korean women and girls, particularly those who have fled into China, are at risk of being kidnapped, trafficked, and sexually exploited inside China, where many are sold as brides or concubines, or forced to work as prostitutes.\n(17) The Governments of China and North Korea have been conducting aggressive campaigns to locate North Koreans who are in China without permission and to forcibly return them to North Korea, where they routinely face torture and imprisonment, and sometimes execution.\n(18) Despite China\u2019s obligations as a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, China routinely classifies North Koreans seeking asylum in China as mere \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d and returns them to North Korea without regard to the serious threat of persecution they face upon their return.\n(19) The Government of China does not provide North Koreans whose asylum requests are rejected a right to have the rejection reviewed prior to deportation despite its obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.\n(20) North Koreans who seek asylum while in China are routinely imprisoned and tortured, and in some cases killed, after they are returned to North Korea.\n(21) The Government of China has detained, convicted, and imprisoned foreign aid workers attempting to assist North Korean refugees in proceedings that did not comply with Chinese law or international standards.\n(22) In January 2000, North Korean agents inside China allegedly abducted the Reverend Kim Dong-shik, a United States permanent resident and advocate for North Korean refugees, whose condition and whereabouts remain unknown.\n(23) Between 1994 and 2003, South Korea has admitted approximately 3,800 North Korean refugees for domestic resettlement, a number that is small in comparison with the total number of North Korean escapees but far greater than the number legally admitted in any other country.\n(24) Although the principal responsibility for North Korean refugee resettlement naturally falls to the Government of South Korea, the United States should play a leadership role in focusing international attention on the plight of these refugees, and formulating international solutions to that profound humanitarian dilemma.\n(25) In addition to infringing the rights of its own citizens, the Government of North Korea has been responsible in years past for the abduction of numerous citizens of South Korea and Japan, whose condition or whereabouts remain unknown.\n\n\u00a7 7704. Policies and procedures relating to children residing on Indian lands.\n(a) In general. A local educational agency that claims children residing on Indian lands for the purpose of receiving funds under section 7703 of this title shall establish policies and procedures to ensure that\u2014\n  (1) such children participate in programs and activities supported by such funds on an equal basis with all other children;\n  (2) parents of such children and Indian tribes are afforded an opportunity to present their views on such programs and activities, including an opportunity to make recommendations on the needs of those children and how the local educational agency may help such children realize the benefits of such programs and activities;\n  (3) parents and Indian tribes are consulted and involved in planning and developing such programs and activities;\n  (4) relevant applications, evaluations, and program plans are disseminated to the parents and Indian tribes; and\n  (5) parents and Indian tribes are afforded an opportunity to present their views to such agency regarding such agency\u2019s general educational program.\n(b) Records. A local educational agency that claims children residing on Indian lands for the purpose of receiving funds under section 7703 of this title shall maintain records demonstrating such agency\u2019s compliance with the requirements contained in subsection (a).\n(c) Waiver. A local educational agency that claims children residing on Indian lands for the purpose of receiving funds under section 7703 of this title shall not be required to comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) for any fiscal year with respect to any Indian tribe from which such agency has received a written statement that the agency need not comply with those subsections because the tribe is satisfied with the provision of educational services by such agency to such children.\n(d) Technical assistance and enforcement. The Secretary shall\u2014\n  (1) provide technical assistance to local educational agencies, parents, and Indian tribes to enable such agencies, parents, and tribes to carry out this section; and\n  (2) enforce this section through such actions, which may include the withholding of funds, as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, after affording the affected local educational agency, parents, and Indian tribe an opportunity to present their views.\n(e) Complaints.\n  (1) In general.\n    (A) Any tribe, or its designee, which has students in attendance at a local educational agency may, in its discretion and without regard to the requirements of any other provision of law, file a written complaint with the Secretary regarding any action of a local educational agency taken pursuant to, or relevant to, the requirements of this section.\n    (B) Within ten working days from receipt of a complaint, the Secretary shall\u2014\n      (i) designate a time and place for a hearing into the matters relating to the complaint at a location in close proximity to the local educational agency involved, or if the Secretary determines there is good cause, at some other location convenient to both the tribe, or its designee, and the local educational agency;\n      (ii) designate a hearing examiner to conduct the hearing; and\n      (iii) notify the affected tribe or tribes and the local educational agency involved of the time, place, and nature of the hearing and send copies of the complaint to the local educational agency and the affected tribe or tribes.\n  (2) Hearing. The hearing shall be held within 30 days of the designation of a hearing examiner and shall be open to the public. A record of the proceedings shall be established and maintained.\n  (3) Evidence; recommendations; cost. The complaining tribe, or its designee, and the local educational agency shall be entitled to present evidence on matters relevant to the complaint and to make recommendations concerning the appropriate remedial actions. Each party to the hearing shall bear only its own costs in the proceedings.\n  (4) Findings and recommendations. Within 30 days of the completion of the hearing, the hearing examiner shall, on the basis of the record, make written findings of fact and recommendations concerning appropriate remedial action, if any, which should be taken. The hearing examiner\u2019s findings and recommendations, along with the hearing record, shall be forwarded to the Secretary.\n  (5) Written determination. Within 30 days of the Secretary\u2019s receipt of the findings, recommendations, and record, the Secretary shall, on the basis of the record, make a written determination of the appropriate remedial action, if any, to be taken by the local educational agency, the schedule for completion of the remedial action, and the reasons for the Secretary\u2019s decision.\n  (6) Copies provided. Upon completion of the Secretary\u2019s final determination, the Secretary shall provide the complaining tribe, or its designee, and the local educational agency with copies of the hearing record, the hearing examiner\u2019s findings and recommendations, and the Secretary\u2019s final determination. The final determination of the Secretary shall be subject to judicial review.\n  (7) Consolidation. In all actions under this subsection, the Secretary shall have discretion to consolidate complaints involving the same tribe or local educational agency.\n  (8) Withholding. If the local educational agency rejects the determination of the Secretary, or if the remedy required is not undertaken within the time established and the Secretary determines that an extension of the time established will not effectively encourage the remedy required, the Secretary shall withhold payment of all moneys to which such local agency is eligible under section 7703 of this title until such time as the remedy required is undertaken, except where the complaining tribe or its designee formally requests that such funds be released to the local educational agency, except that the Secretary may not withhold such moneys during the course of the school year if the Secretary determines that such withholding would substantially disrupt the educational programs of the local educational agency.\n  (9) Rejection of determination. If the local educational agency rejects the determination of the Secretary and a tribe exercises the option under section 1101(d) of the Education Amendments of 1978, to have education services provided either directly by the Bureau of Indian Education or by contract with the Bureau of Indian Education, any Indian students affiliated with that tribe who wish to remain in attendance at the local educational agency against whom the complaint which led to the tribal action under such subsection (d) was lodged may be counted with respect to that local educational agency for the purpose of receiving funds under section 7703 of this title. In such event, funds under such section shall not be withheld pursuant to paragraph (8) and no further complaints with respect to such students may be filed under paragraph (1).\n(f) Construction. This section is based upon the special relationship between the Indian nations and the United States and nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any State of any duty with respect to any citizens of that State.\n\nWhat is the exact text of just section 7801(25) above?", "idx_line": 26, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 7801", "line_text": "\u00a7 7801.

This section shall not apply to property acquired by a corporation by the exchange of its stock or securities (or the stock or securities of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation) as consideration in whole or in part for the transfer of the property to it.\n(f) Definition of nonrecognition property in case of section 361 exchange. For purposes of this section, the property permitted to be received under section 361 without the recognition of gain or loss shall be treated as consisting only of stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization.\n(g) Adjustments in intragroup transactions involving section 355.

For purposes of this section, the term \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d means, with respect to any taxable year, an applicable financial statement (as defined in section 451(b)(3) or as specified by the Secretary in regulations or other guidance) which covers such taxable year.\n(c) General adjustments.\n  (1) Statements covering different taxable years. Appropriate adjustments shall be made in adjusted financial statement income in any case in which an applicable financial statement covers a period other than the taxable year.\n  (2) Special rules for related entities.\n    (A) Consolidated financial statements. If the financial results of a taxpayer are reported on the applicable financial statement for a group of entities, rules similar to the rules of section 451(b)(5) shall apply.\n    (B) Consolidated returns. Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if the taxpayer is part of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return for any taxable year, adjusted financial statement income for such group for such taxable year shall take into account items on the group\u2019s applicable financial statement which are properly allocable to members of such group.\n    (C) Treatment of dividends and other amounts. In the case of any corporation which is not included on a consolidated return with the taxpayer, adjusted financial statement income of the taxpayer with respect to such other corporation shall be determined by only taking into account the dividends received from such other corporation (reduced to the extent provided by the Secretary in regulations or other guidance) and other amounts which are includible in gross income or deductible as a loss under this chapter (other than amounts required to be included under sections 951 and 951A or such other amounts as provided by the Secretary) with respect to such other corporation.\n    (D) Treatment of partnerships.\n      (i) In general. Except as provided by the Secretary, if the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership, adjusted financial statement income of the taxpayer with respect to such partnership shall be adjusted to only take into account the taxpayer\u2019s distributive share of adjusted financial statement income of such partnership.\n      (ii) Adjusted financial statement income of partnerships.

If, for any taxable year, a taxpayer is a United States shareholder of one or more controlled foreign corporations, the adjusted financial statement income of such taxpayer with respect to such controlled foreign corporation (as determined under paragraph (2)(C)) shall be adjusted to also take into account such taxpayer\u2019s pro rata share (determined under rules similar to the rules under section 951(a)(2)) of items taken into account in computing the net income or loss set forth on the applicable financial statement (as adjusted under rules similar to those that apply in determining adjusted financial statement income) of each such controlled foreign corporation with respect to which such taxpayer is a United States shareholder.\n    (B) Negative adjustments. In any case in which the adjustment determined under subparagraph (A) would result in a negative adjustment for such taxable year\u2014\n      (i) no adjustment shall be made under this paragraph for such taxable year, and\n      (ii) the amount of the adjustment determined under this paragraph for the succeeding taxable year (determined without regard to this paragraph) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the negative adjustment for such taxable year.\n  (4) Effectively connected income.

To the extent provided by the Secretary, the preceding sentence shall not apply to income, war profits, or excess profits taxes (within the meaning of section 901) that are imposed by a foreign country or possession of the United States and taken into account on the taxpayer\u2019s applicable financial statement if the taxpayer does not choose to have the benefits of subpart A of part III of subchapter N for the taxable year. The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations or other guidance as may be necessary and appropriate to provide for the proper treatment of current and deferred taxes for purposes of this paragraph, including the time at which such taxes are properly taken into account.\n  (6) Adjustment with respect to disregarded entities. Adjusted financial statement income shall be adjusted to take into account any adjusted financial statement income of a disregarded entity owned by the taxpayer.\n  (7) Special rule for cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative to which section 1381 applies, the adjusted financial statement income (determined without regard to this paragraph) shall be reduced by the amounts referred to in section 1382(b) (relating to patronage dividends and per-unit retain allocations) to the extent such amounts were not otherwise taken into account in determining adjusted financial statement income.\n  (8) Rules for Alaska native corporations. Adjusted financial statement income shall be appropriately adjusted to allow\u2014\n    (A) cost recovery and depletion attributable to property the basis of which is determined under section 21(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1621(c)), and\n    (B) deductions for amounts payable made pursuant to section 7(i) or section 7(j) of such Act (43 U.S.C. 1606(i) and 1606(j)) only at such time as the deductions are allowed for tax purposes.\n  (9) Amounts attributable to elections for direct payment of certain credits. Adjusted financial statement income shall be appropriately adjusted to disregard any amount treated as a payment against the tax imposed by subtitle A pursuant to an election under section 48D(d) or 6417, to the extent such amount was not otherwise taken into account under paragraph (5).\n  (10) Consistent treatment of mortgage servicing income of taxpayer other than a regulated investment company.\n    (A) In general. Adjusted financial statement income shall be adjusted so as not to include any item of income in connection with a mortgage servicing contract any earlier than when such income is included in gross income under any other provision of this chapter.\n    (B) Rules for amounts not representing reasonable compensation. The Secretary shall provide regulations to prevent the avoidance of taxes imposed by this chapter with respect to amounts not representing reasonable compensation (as determined by the Secretary) with respect to a mortgage servicing contract.\n  (11) Adjustment with respect to defined benefit pensions.\n    (A) In general. Except as otherwise provided in rules prescribed by the Secretary in regulations or other guidance, adjusted financial statement income shall be\u2014\n      (i) adjusted to disregard any amount of income, cost, or expense that would otherwise be included on the applicable financial statement in connection with any covered benefit plan,\n      (ii) increased by any amount of income in connection with any such covered benefit plan that is included in the gross income of the corporation under any other provision of this chapter, and\n      (iii) reduced by deductions allowed under any other provision of this chapter with respect to any such covered benefit plan.\n    (B) Covered benefit plan. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \u201ccovered benefit plan\u201d means\u2014\n      (i) a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan described in section 414(f)) if the trust which is part of such plan is an employees\u2019 trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a),\n      (ii) any qualified foreign plan (as defined in section 404A(e)), or\n      (iii) any other defined benefit plan which provides post-employment benefits other than pension benefits.\n  (12) Tax-exempt entities. In the case of an organization subject to tax under section 511, adjusted financial statement income shall be appropriately adjusted to only take into account any adjusted financial statement income\u2014\n    (A) of an unrelated trade or business (as defined in section 513) of such organization, or\n    (B) derived from debt-financed property (as defined in section 514) to the extent that income from such property is treated as unrelated business taxable income.\n  (13) Depreciation. Adjusted financial statement income shall be\u2014\n    (A) reduced by depreciation deductions allowed under section 167 with respect to property to which section 168 applies to the extent of the amount allowed as deductions in computing taxable income for the taxable year, and\n    (B) appropriately adjusted\u2014\n      (i) to disregard any amount of depreciation expense that is taken into account on the taxpayer\u2019s applicable financial statement with respect to such property, and\n      (ii) to take into account any other item specified by the Secretary in order to provide that such property is accounted for in the same manner as it is accounted for under this chapter.\n  (14) Qualified wireless spectrum.\n    (A) In general. Adjusted financial statement income shall be\u2014\n      (i) reduced by amortization deductions allowed under section 197 with respect to qualified wireless spectrum to the extent of the amount allowed as deductions in computing taxable income for the taxable year, and\n      (ii) appropriately adjusted\u2014\n        (I) to disregard any amount of amortization expense that is taken into account on the taxpayer\u2019s applicable financial statement with respect to such qualified wireless spectrum, and\n        (II) to take into account any other item specified by the Secretary in order to provide that such qualified wireless spectrum is accounted for in the same manner as it is accounted for under this chapter.\n    (B) Qualified wireless spectrum.

The limitation contained in this subparagraph shall not apply to a rural telephone company that is providing video programming on February 8, 1996.\n  (2) Suspensions and modifications for rural carriers. A local exchange carrier with fewer than 2 percent of the Nation\u2019s subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide may petition a State commission for a suspension or modification of the application of a requirement or requirements of subsection (b) or (c) to telephone exchange service facilities specified in such petition. The State commission shall grant such petition to the extent that, and for such duration as, the State commission determines that such suspension or modification\u2014\n    (A) is necessary\u2014\n      (i) to avoid a significant adverse economic impact on users of telecommunications services generally;\n      (ii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is unduly economically burdensome; or\n      (iii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is technically infeasible; and\n    (B) is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\n  The State commission shall act upon any petition filed under this paragraph within 180 days after receiving such petition. Pending such action, the State commission may suspend enforcement of the requirement or requirements to which the petition applies with respect to the petitioning carrier or carriers.\n(g) Continued enforcement of exchange access and interconnection requirements. On and after February 8, 1996, each local exchange carrier, to the extent that it provides wireline services, shall provide exchange access, information access, and exchange services for such access to interexchange carriers and information service providers in accordance with the same equal access and nondiscriminatory interconnection restrictions and obligations (including receipt of compensation) that apply to such carrier on the date immediately preceding February 8, 1996, under any court order, consent decree, or regulation, order, or policy of the Commission, until such restrictions and obligations are explicitly superseded by regulations prescribed by the Commission after February 8, 1996. During the period beginning on February 8, 1996, and until such restrictions and obligations are so superseded, such restrictions and obligations shall be enforceable in the same manner as regulations of the Commission.\n(h) \u201cIncumbent local exchange carrier\u201d defined.\n  (1) Definition. For purposes of this section, the term \u201cincumbent local exchange carrier\u201d means, with respect to an area, the local exchange carrier that\u2014\n    (A) on February 8, 1996, provided telephone exchange service in such area; and\n    (B)\n      (i) on February 8, 1996, was deemed to be a member of the exchange carrier association pursuant to section 69.601(b) of the Commission\u2019s regulations (47 C.F.R. 69.601(b)); or\n      (ii) is a person or entity that, on or after February 8, 1996, became a successor or assign of a member described in clause (i).\n  (2) Treatment of comparable carriers as incumbents. The Commission may, by rule, provide for the treatment of a local exchange carrier (or class or category thereof) as an incumbent local exchange carrier for purposes of this section if\u2014\n    (A) such carrier occupies a position in the market for telephone exchange service within an area that is comparable to the position occupied by a carrier described in paragraph (1);\n    (B) such carrier has substantially replaced an incumbent local exchange carrier described in paragraph (1); and\n    (C) such treatment is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity and the purposes of this section.\n(i) Savings provision. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the Commission\u2019s authority under section 201 of this title.\n\nWhat is the exact text of just section 251(e)(1) above?", "idx_line": 33, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 251", "line_text": "\u00a7 251.

Dumping permit program for dredged mate\u00adrial.\n(a) Issuance by Secretary of the Army. Subject to the provisions of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Secretary may issue permits, after notice and opportunity for public hearings, for the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters, where the Secretary determines that the dumping will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities.\n(b) Independent determination of need for dumping, other methods of disposal, and appropriate locations; alternative sites. In making the determination required by subsection (a), the Secretary shall apply those criteria, established pursuant to section 1412(a) of this title, relating to the effects of the dumping. Based upon an evaluation of the potential effect of a permit denial on navigation, economic and industrial development, and foreign and domestic commerce of the United States, the Secretary shall make an independent determination as to the need for the dumping. The Secretary shall also make an independent determination as to other possible methods of disposal and as to appropriate locations for the dumping. In considering appropriate locations, he shall, to the maximum extent feasible, utilize the recommended sites designated by the Administrator pursuant to section 1412(c) of this title. In any case in which the use of a designated site is not feasible, the Secretary may, with the concurrence of the Administrator, select an alternative site. The criteria and factors established in section 1412(a) of this title relating to site selection shall be used in selecting the alternative site in a manner consistent with the application of such factors and criteria pursuant to section 1412(c) of this title. Disposal at or in the vicinity of an alternative site shall be limited to a period of not greater than 5 years unless the site is subsequently designated pursuant to section 1412(c) of this title; except that an alternative site may continue to be used for an additional period of time that shall not exceed 5 years if\u2014\n  (1) unless otherwise provided by section 101, no feasible disposal site has been designated by the Administrator;\n  (2) the continued use of the alternative site is necessary to maintain navigation and facilitate interstate or international commerce; and\n  (3) the Administrator determines that the continued use of the site does not pose an unacceptable risk to human health, aquatic resources, or the environment.\n(c) Concurrence by Administrator.\n  (1) Notification. Prior to issuing a permit to any person under this section, the Secretary shall first notify the Administrator of the Secretary\u2019s intention to do so and provide necessary and appropriate information concerning the permit to the Administrator. Within 30 days of receiving such information, the Administrator shall review the information and request any additional information the Administrator deems necessary to evaluate the proposed permit.\n  (2) Concurrence by Administrator. Within 45 days after receiving from the Secretary all information the Administrator considers to be necessary to evaluate the proposed permit, the Administrator shall, in writing, concur with (either entirely or with conditions) or decline to concur with the determination of the Secretary as to compliance with the criteria, conditions, and restrictions established pursuant to sections 1412(a) and 1412(c) of this title relating to the environmental impact of the permit. The Administrator may request one 45-day extension in writing and the Secretary shall grant such request on receipt of the request.\n  (3) Effect of concurrence. In any case where the Administrator makes a determination to concur (with or without conditions) or to decline to concur within the time period specified in paragraph (2) the determination shall prevail. If the Administrator declines to concur in the determination of the Secretary no permit shall be issued. If the Administrator concurs with conditions the permit shall include such conditions. The Administrator shall state in writing the reasons for declining to concur or for the conditions of the concurrence.\n  (4) Failure to act. If no written documentation is made by the Administrator within the time period provided for in paragraph (2), the Secretary may issue the permit.\n  (5) Compliance with criteria and restrictions. Unless the Administrator grants a waiver pursuant to subsection (d), any permit issued by the Secretary shall require compliance with such criteria and restrictions.\n(d) Waiver of requirements. If, in any case, the Secretary finds that, in the disposition of dredged material, there is no economically feasible method or site available other than a dumping site the utilization of which would result in non-compliance with the criteria established pursuant to section 1412(a) of this title relating to the effects of dumping or with the restrictions established pursuant to section 1412(c) of this title relating to critical areas, he shall so certify and request a waiver from the Administrator of the specific requirements involved. Within thirty days of the receipt of the waiver request, unless the Administrator finds that the dumping of the material will result in an unacceptably adverse impact on municipal water supplies, shell-fish beds, wildlife, fisheries (including spawning and breeding areas), or recreational areas, he shall grant the waiver.\n(e) Federal projects involving dredged material. In connection with Federal projects involving dredged material, the Secretary may, in lieu of the permit procedure, issue regulations which will require the application to such projects of the same criteria, other factors to be evaluated, the same procedures, and the same requirements which apply to the issuance of permits under subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section and section 1414(a) and (d) of this title.\n\nWhat is the exact text of just section 1413(b)(1) above?", "idx_line": 49, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 14502a", "line_text": "\u00a7 14502a.

No entity engaged in the manufacture, processing, packing, transporting, distribution, reception, holding, or importation of food may discharge an employee or otherwise discriminate against an employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee, whether at the employee\u2019s initiative or in the ordinary course of the employee\u2019s duties (or any person acting pursuant to a request of the employee)\u2014\n  (1) provided, caused to be provided, or is about to provide or cause to be provided to the employer, the Federal Government, or the attorney general of a State information relating to any violation of, or any act or omission the employee reasonably believes to be a violation of any provision of this chapter or any order, rule, regulation, standard, or ban under this chapter, or any order, rule, regulation, standard, or ban under this chapter;\n  (2) testified or is about to testify in a proceeding concerning such violation;\n  (3) assisted or participated or is about to assist or participate in such a proceeding; or\n  (4) objected to, or refused to participate in, any activity, policy, practice, or assigned task that the employee (or other such person) reasonably believed to be in violation of any provision of this chapter, or any order, rule, regulation, standard, or ban under this chapter.\n(b) Process.\n  (1) In general. A person who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of subsection (a) may, not later than 180 days after the date on which such violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his or her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary of Labor (referred to in this section as the \u201cSecretary\u201d) alleging such discharge or discrimination and identifying the person responsible for such act. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Secretary shall notify, in writing, the person named in the complaint of the filing of the complaint, of the allegations contained in the complaint, of the substance of evidence supporting the complaint, and of the opportunities that will be afforded to such person under paragraph (2).\n  (2) Investigation.\n    (A) In general. Not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph (1) and after affording the complainant and the person named in the complaint an opportunity to submit to the Secretary a written response to the complaint and an opportunity to meet with a representative of the Secretary to present statements from witnesses, the Secretary shall initiate an investigation and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint has merit and notify, in writing, the complainant and the person alleged to have committed a violation of subsection (a) of the Secretary\u2019s findings.\n    (B) Reasonable cause found; preliminary order. If the Secretary concludes that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary shall accompany the Secretary\u2019s findings with a preliminary order providing the relief prescribed by paragraph (3)(B). Not later than 30 days after the date of notification of findings under this paragraph, the person alleged to have committed the violation or the complainant may file objections to the findings or preliminary order, or both, and request a hearing on the record. The filing of such objections shall not operate to stay any reinstatement remedy contained in the preliminary order. Any such hearing shall be conducted expeditiously. If a hearing is not requested in such 30-day period, the preliminary order shall be deemed a final order that is not subject to judicial review.\n    (C) Dismissal of complaint.\n      (i) Standard for complainant. The Secretary shall dismiss a complaint filed under this subsection and shall not conduct an investigation otherwise required under subparagraph (A) unless the complainant makes a prima facie showing that any behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n      (ii) Standard for employer. Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary that the complainant has made the showing required under clause (i), no investigation otherwise required under subparagraph (A) shall be conducted if the employer demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.\n      (iii) Violation standard. The Secretary may determine that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred only if the complainant demonstrates that any behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n      (iv) Relief standard. Relief may not be ordered under subparagraph (A) if the employer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.\n  (3) Final order.\n    (A) In general. Not later than 120 days after the date of conclusion of any hearing under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall issue a final order providing the relief prescribed by this paragraph or denying the complaint. At any time before issuance of a final order, a proceeding under this subsection may be terminated on the basis of a settlement agreement entered into by the Secretary, the complainant, and the person alleged to have committed the violation.\n    (B) Content of order. If, in response to a complaint filed under paragraph (1), the Secretary determines that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary shall order the person who committed such violation\u2014\n      (i) to take affirmative action to abate the violation;\n      (ii) to reinstate the complainant to his or her former position together with compensation (including back pay) and restore the terms, conditions, and privileges associated with his or her employment; and\n      (iii) to provide compensatory damages to the complainant.\n    (C) Penalty. If such an order is issued under this paragraph, the Secretary, at the request of the complainant, shall assess against the person against whom the order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees) reasonably incurred, as determined by the Secretary, by the complainant for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint upon which the order was issued.\n    (D) Bad faith claim. If the Secretary finds that a complaint under paragraph (1) is frivolous or has been brought in bad faith, the Secretary may award to the prevailing employer a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee, not exceeding $1,000, to be paid by the complainant.\n  (4) Action in court.\n    (A) In general. If the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 210 days after the filing of the complaint, or within 90 days after receiving a written determination, the complainant may bring an action at law or equity for de novo review in the appropriate district court of the United States with jurisdiction, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy, and which action shall, at the request of either party to such action, be tried by the court with a jury. The proceedings shall be governed by the same legal burdens of proof specified in paragraph (2)(C).\n    (B) Relief. The court shall have jurisdiction to grant all relief necessary to make the employee whole, including injunctive relief and compensatory damages, including\u2014\n      (i) reinstatement with the same seniority status that the employee would have had, but for the discharge or discrimination;\n      (ii) unless otherwise provided by section 101, the amount of back pay, with interest; and\n      (iii) compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discharge or discrimination, including litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\n  (5) Review.\n    (A) In general. Unless the complainant brings an action under paragraph (4), any person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order issued under paragraph (3) may obtain review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the order was issued, allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of such violation. The petition for review must be filed not later than 60 days after the date of the issuance of the final order of the Secretary. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5. The commencement of proceedings under this subparagraph shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the order.\n    (B) No judicial review. An order of the Secretary with respect to which review could have been obtained under subparagraph (A) shall not be subject to judicial review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.\n  (6) Failure to comply with order. Whenever any person has failed to comply with an order issued under paragraph (3), the Secretary may file a civil action in the United States district court for the district in which the violation was found to occur, or in the United States district court for the District of Columbia, to enforce such order. In actions brought under this paragraph, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief including, but not limited to, injunctive relief and compensatory damages.\n  (7) Civil action to require compliance.\n    (A) In general. A person on whose behalf an order was issued under paragraph (3) may commence a civil action against the person to whom such order was issued to require compliance with such order. The appropriate United States district court shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce such order.\n    (B) Award. The court, in issuing any final order under this paragraph, may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees) to any party whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.\n(c) Effect of section.\n  (1) Other laws. Nothing in this section preempts or diminishes any other safeguards against discrimination, demotion, discharge, suspension, threats, harassment, reprimand, retaliation, or any other manner of discrimination provided by Federal or State law.\n  (2) Rights of employees. Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish the rights, privileges, or remedies of any employee under any Federal or State law or under any collective bargaining agreement. The rights and remedies in this section may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment.\n(d) Enforcement. Any nondiscretionary duty imposed by this section shall be enforceable in a mandamus proceeding brought under section 1361 of title 28.\n(e) Limitation. Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to an employee of an entity engaged in the manufacture, processing, packing, transporting, distribution, reception, holding, or importation of food who, acting without direction from such entity (or such entity\u2019s agent), deliberately causes a violation of any requirement relating to any violation or alleged violation of any order, rule, regulation, standard, or ban under this chapter.\n\nWhat is the exact text of just section 399d(b)(4)(B)(ii) above?", "idx_line": 28, "text_lines": [{"cite": "section 399d", "line_text": "\u00a7 399d.

The Secretary may use such repaid funds to make additional challenge grants, or to increase existing endowment grants, to other eligible institutions.\n  (2) If an institution expends more of the endowment fund income than is permitted under subsection (c), the institution shall repay the Secretary an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount improperly expended (representing the Federal share thereof).

Any institution which is eligible for assistance under this section may submit to the Secretary a grant application at such time, in such form, and containing such information as the Secretary may prescribe, including a description of the long- and short-term plans for raising and using the funds under this part. Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this section and consistent with the requirement of subsection (f), the Secretary may approve an application for a grant if an institution, in its application, provides adequate assurances that it will comply with the requirements of this section.\n(h) Termination and recovery provisions.\n  (1) After notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary may terminate and recover a grant awarded under this section if the grantee institution\u2014\n    (A) expends portions of the endowment fund corpus or expends more than the permissible amount of the endowment funds income as prescribed in subsection (c)(3);\n    (B) fails to invest the endowment fund in accordance with the investment standards set forth in subsection (c)(2); or\n    (C) fails to properly account to the Secretary concerning the investment and expenditures of the endowment funds.\n  (2) If the Secretary terminates a grant under paragraph (1), the grantee shall return to the Secretary an amount equal to the sum of each original grant under this section plus income earned thereon. The Secretary may use such repaid funds to make additional endowment grants, or to increase existing challenge grants, to other eligible institutions under this part.\n(i) Technical assistance.

In undertaking the consideration and making the determination under section 2621 of this title with respect to the standard concerning cost of service established by section 2621(d)(1) of this title, the costs of providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be determined on the basis of methods prescribed by the State regulatory authority (in the case of a State regulated electric utility) or by the electric utility (in the case of a nonregulated electric utility). Such methods shall to the maximum extent practicable\u2014\n  (1) permit identification of differences in cost-incurrence, for each such class of electric consumers, attributable to daily and seasonal time of use of service and\n  (2) permit identification of differences in cost-incurrence attributable to differences in customer demand, and energy components of cost. In prescribing such methods, such State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility shall take into account the extent to which total costs to an electric utility are likely to change if\u2014\n    (A) additional capacity is added to meet peak demand relative to base demand; and\n    (B) additional kilowatt-hours of electric energy are delivered to electric consumers.\n(b) Time-of-day rates. In undertaking the consideration and making the determination required under section 2621 of this title with respect to the standard for time-of-day rates established by section 2621(d)(3) of this title and the standard for time-based metering and communications established by section 2621(d)(14) of this title, a time-of-day rate charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be determined to be cost-effective with respect to each such class if the long-run benefits of such rate to the electric utility and its electric consumers in the class concerned are likely to exceed the metering and communications costs and other costs associated with the use of such rates.\n(c) Load management techniques. In undertaking the consideration and making the determination required under section 2621 of this title with respect to the standard for load management techniques established by section 2621(d)(6) of this title, a load management technique shall be determined, by the State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility, to be cost-effective if\u2014\n  (1) such technique is likely to reduce maximum kilowatt demand on the electric utility, and\n  (2) the long-run cost-savings to the utility of such reduction are likely to exceed the long-run costs to the utility associated with implementation of such technique.\n(d) Master metering. Separate metering shall be determined appropriate for any new building for purposes of section 2623(b)(1) of this title if\u2014\n  (1) there is more than one unit in such building,\n  (2) the occupant of each such unit has control over a portion of the electric energy used in such unit, and\n  (3) with respect to such portion of electric energy used in such unit, the long-run benefits to the electric consumers in such building exceed the costs of purchasing and installing separate meters in such building.\n(e) Automatic adjustment clauses.\n  (1) An automatic adjustment clause of an electric utility meets the requirements of this subsection if\u2014\n    (A) such clause is determined, not less often than every four years, by the State regulatory authority (with respect to an electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or by the electric utility (in the case of a nonregulated electric utility), after an evidentiary hearing, to provide incentives for efficient use of resources (including incentives for economical purchase and use of fuel and electric energy) by such electric utility, and\n    (B) such clause is reviewed not less often than every two years, in the manner described in paragraph (2), by the State regulatory authority having ratemaking authority with respect to such utility (or by the electric utility in the case of a nonregulated electric utility), to insure the maximum economies in those operations and purchases which affect the rates to which such clause applies.\n  (2) In making a review under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) with respect to an electric utility, the reviewing authority shall examine and, if appropriate, cause to be audited the practices of such electric utility relating to costs subject to an automatic adjustment clause, and shall require such reports as may be necessary to carry out such review (including a disclosure of any ownership or corporate relationship between such electric utility and the seller to such utility of fuel, electric energy, or other items).\n  (3) As used in this subsection and section 2623(b) of this title, the term \u201cautomatic adjustment clause\u201d means a provision of a rate schedule which provides for increases or decreases (or both), without prior hearing, in rates reflecting increases or decreases (or both) in costs incurred by an electric utility. Such term does not include an interim rate which takes effect subject to a later determination of the appropriate amount of the rate.\n(f) Information to consumers.\n  (1) For purposes of the standard for information to consumers established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title, each electric utility shall transmit to each of its electric consumers a clear and concise explanation of the existing rate schedule and any rate schedule applied for (or proposed by a nonregulated electric utility) applicable to such consumer. Such statement shall be transmitted to each such consumer\u2014\n    (A) not later than sixty days after the date of commencement of service to such consumer or ninety days after the standard established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title is adopted with respect to such electric utility, whichever last occurs, and\n    (B) not later than thirty days (sixty days in the case of an electric utility which uses a bimonthly billing system) after such utility\u2019s application for any change in a rate schedule applicable to such consumer (or proposal of such a change in the case of a nonregulated utility).\n  (2) For purposes of the standard for information to consumers established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title, each electric utility shall transmit to each of its electric consumers not less frequently than once each year\u2014\n    (A) a clear and concise summary of the existing rate schedules applicable to each of the major classes of its electric consumers for which there is a separate rate, and\n    (B) an identification of any classes whose rates are not summarized.\n  Such summary may be transmitted together with such consumer\u2019s billing or in such other manner as the State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility deems appropriate.\n  (3) For purposes of the standard for information to consumers established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title, each electric utility, on request of an electric consumer of such utility, shall transmit to such consumer a clear and concise statement of the actual consumption (or degree-day adjusted consumption) of electric energy by such consumer for each billing period during the prior year (unless such consumption data is not reasonably ascertainable by the utility).\n(g) Procedures for termination of electric service. The procedures for termination of service referred to in section 2623(b)(4) of this title are procedures prescribed by the State regulatory authority (with respect to electric utilities for which it has ratemaking authority) or by the nonregulated electric utility which provide that\u2014\n  (1) no electric service to an electric consumer may be terminated unless reasonable prior notice (including notice of rights and remedies) is given to such consumer and such consumer has a reasonable opportunity to dispute the reasons for such termination, and\n  (2) during any period when termination of service to an electric consumer would be especially dangerous to health, as determined by the State regulatory authority (with respect to an electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility, and such consumer establishes that\u2014\n    (A) he is unable to pay for such service in accordance with the requirements of the utility\u2019s billing, or\n    (B) he is able to pay for such service but only in installments,\n  such service may not be terminated.\nSuch procedures shall take into account the need to include reasonable provisions for elderly and handicapped consumers.\n(h) Advertising.\n  (1) For purposes of this section and section 2623(b)(5) of this title\u2014\n    (A) The term \u201cadvertising\u201d means the commercial use, by an electric utility, of any media, including newspaper, printed matter, radio, and television, in order to transmit a message to a substantial number of members of the public or to such utility\u2019s electric consumers.\n    (B) The term \u201cpolitical advertising\u201d means any advertising for the purpose of influencing public opinion with respect to legislative, administrative, or electoral matters, or with respect to any controversial issue of public importance.\n    (C) The term \u201cpromotional advertising\u201d means any advertising for the purpose of encouraging any person to select or use the service or additional service of an electric utility or the selection or installation of any appliance or equipment designed to use such utility\u2019s service.\n  (2) For purposes of this subsection and section 2623(b)(5) of this title, the terms \u201cpolitical advertising\u201d and \u201cpromotional advertising\u201d do not include\u2014\n    (A) advertising which informs electric consumers how they can conserve energy or can reduce peak demand for electric energy,\n    (B) advertising required by law or regulation, including advertising required under part 1 of title II of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act [42 U.S.C. 8211 et seq.],\n    (C) advertising regarding service interruptions, safety measures, or emergency conditions,\n    (D) unless otherwise provided by section 101, advertising concerning employment opportunities with such utility,\n    (E) advertising which promotes the use of energy efficient appliances, equipment or services, or\n    (F) any explanation or justification of existing or proposed rate schedules, or notifications of hearings thereon.\n(i) Time-based metering and communications.

When a violation of any right of the registrant of a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, a violation under section 1125(a) or (d) of this title, or a willful violation under section 1125(c) of this title, shall have been established in any civil action arising under this chapter, the plaintiff shall be entitled, subject to the provisions of sections 1111 and 1114 of this title, and subject to the principles of equity, to recover (1) defendant\u2019s profits, (2) any damages sustained by the plaintiff, and (3) the costs of the action. The court shall assess such profits and damages or cause the same to be assessed under its direction. In assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant\u2019s sales only; defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed. In assessing damages the court may enter judgment, according to the circumstances of the case, for any sum above the amount found as actual damages, not exceeding three times such amount. If the court shall find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive the court may in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just, according to the circumstances of the case. Such sum in either of the above circumstances shall constitute compensation and not a penalty. The court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\n(b) Treble damages for use of counterfeit mark. In assessing damages under subsection (a) for any violation of section 1114(1)(a) of this title or section 220506 of title 36, in a case involving use of a counterfeit mark or designation (as defined in section 1116(d) of this title), the court shall, unless the court finds extenuating circumstances, enter judgment for three times such profits or damages, whichever amount is greater, together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, if the violation consists of\u2014\n  (1) intentionally using a mark or designation, knowing such mark or designation is a counterfeit mark (as defined in section 1116(d) of this title), in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services; or\n  (2) providing goods or services necessary to the commission of a violation specified in paragraph (1), with the intent that the recipient of the goods or services would put the goods or services to use in committing the violation.\nIn such a case, the court may award prejudgment interest on such amount at an annual interest rate established under section 6621(a)(2) of title 26, beginning on the date of the service of the claimant\u2019s pleadings setting forth the claim for such entry of judgment and ending on the date such entry is made, or for such shorter time as the court considers appropriate.\n(c) Statutory damages for use of counterfeit marks. In a case involving the use of a counterfeit mark (as defined in section 1116(d) of this title) in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services, the plaintiff may elect, at any time before final judgment is rendered by the trial court, to recover, instead of actual damages and profits under subsection (a), an award of statutory damages for any such use in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services in the amount of\u2014\n  (1) not less than $1,000 or more than $200,000 per counterfeit mark per type of goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as the court considers just; or\n  (2) if the court finds that the use of the counterfeit mark was willful, not more than $2,000,000 per counterfeit mark per type of goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as the court considers just.\n(d) Statutory damages for violation of section 1125(d)(1). In a case involving a violation of section 1125(d)(1) of this title, the plaintiff may elect, at any time before final judgment is rendered by the trial court, to recover, instead of actual damages and profits, an award of statutory damages in the amount of not less than $1,000 and not more than $100,000 per domain name, as the court considers just.\n(e) Rebuttable presumption of willful violation. In the case of a violation referred to in this section, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that the violation is willful for purposes of determining relief if the violator, or a person acting in concert with the violator, knowingly provided or knowingly caused to be provided materially false contact information to a domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name registration authority in registering, maintaining, or renewing a domain name used in connection with the violation. Nothing in this subsection limits what may be considered a willful violation under this section.\n\n\u00a7 4370m\u20134. Coordination of required reviews.\n(a) Concurrent reviews. To integrate environmental reviews and authorizations, each agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable\u2014\n  (1) carry out the obligations of the agency with respect to a covered project under any other applicable law concurrently, and in conjunction with, other environmental reviews and authorizations being conducted by other cooperating or participating agencies, including environmental reviews and authorizations required under NEPA, unless the agency determines that doing so would impair the ability of the agency to carry out the statutory obligations of the agency;\n  (2) formulate and implement administrative, policy, and procedural mechanisms to enable the agency to ensure completion of the environmental review process in a timely, coordinated, and environmentally responsible manner; and\n  (3) where an environmental impact statement is required for a project, prepare a single, joint interagency environmental impact statement for the project unless the lead agency provides justification in the coordinated project plan that multiple environmental documents are more efficient for project review and authorization.\n(b) Adoption, incorporation by reference, and use of documents.\n  (1) Use of existing documents.\n    (A) In general. On the request of a project sponsor, a lead agency shall consider and, as appropriate, adopt or incorporate by reference, the analysis and documentation that has been prepared for a covered project under the laws and procedures of a State or Indian Tribe (as defined in section 5130 of title 25) as the documentation, or part of the documentation, required to complete an environmental review for the covered project, if the analysis and documentation were, as determined by the lead agency in consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality, developed pursuant to laws and procedures of that State or Indian Tribe (as so defined) that are of equal or greater rigor to each applicable Federal law and procedure, and prepared under circumstances that allowed for opportunities for public participation and consideration of alternatives, environmental consequences, and other required analyses that are substantially equivalent to what would have been available had the documents and analysis been prepared by a Federal agency pursuant to NEPA.\n    (B) Guidance by CEQ. The Council on Environmental Quality may issue guidance to carry out this subsection.\n  (2) NEPA obligations. An environmental document adopted under paragraph (1) or a document that includes documentation incorporated under paragraph (1) may serve as the documentation required for an environmental review or a supplemental environmental review required to be prepared by a lead agency under NEPA.\n  (3) Supplementation of State documents. If the lead agency adopts or incorporates analysis and documentation described in paragraph (1), the lead agency shall prepare and publish a supplemental document if the lead agency determines that during the period after preparation of the analysis and documentation and before the adoption or incorporation\u2014\n    (A) a significant change has been made to the covered project that is relevant for purposes of environmental review of the project; or\n    (B) there has been a significant circumstance or new information has emerged that is relevant to the environmental review for the covered project.\n  (4) Comments. If a lead agency prepares and publishes a supplemental document under paragraph (3), the lead agency shall solicit comments from other agencies and the public on the supplemental document for a period of not more than 45 days, beginning on the date on which the supplemental document is published, unless\u2014\n    (A) the lead agency, the project sponsor, and any cooperating agency agree to a longer deadline; or\n    (B) the lead agency extends the deadline for good cause.\n  (5) Notice of outcome of environmental review. A lead agency shall issue a record of decision or finding of no significant impact, as appropriate, based on the document adopted under paragraph (1) and any supplemental document prepared under paragraph (3).\n(c) Alternatives analysis.\n  (1) Participation.\n    (A) In general. As early as practicable during the environmental review, but not later than the commencement of scoping for a project requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement, the lead agency shall engage the cooperating agencies and the public to determine the range of reasonable alternatives to be considered for a covered project.\n    (B) Determination. The determination under subparagraph (A) shall be completed not later than the completion of scoping.\n  (2) Range of alternatives.\n    (A) In general.
