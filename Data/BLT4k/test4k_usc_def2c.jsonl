The Secretary may provide by regulations for the application of this paragraph at times other than the times provided in this paragraph.\n(b) Exceptions.\n  (1) In general. Subsection (a) shall not apply to\u2014\n    (A) any security held for investment,\n    (B)\n      (i) any security described in subsection (c)(2)(C) which is acquired (including originated) by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of a trade or business of the taxpayer and which is not held for sale, and (ii) any obligation to acquire a security described in clause (i) if such obligation is entered into in the ordinary course of such trade or business and is not held for sale, and\n    (C) any security which is a hedge with respect to\u2014\n      (i) a security to which subsection (a) does not apply, or\n      (ii) a position, right to income, or a liability which is not a security in the hands of the taxpayer.\n  To the extent provided in regulations, subparagraph (C) shall not apply to any security held by a person in its capacity as a dealer in securities.\n  (2) Identification required. A security shall not be treated as described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1), as the case may be, unless such security is clearly identified in the dealer\u2019s records as being described in such subparagraph before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into (or such other time as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe).\n  (3) Securities subsequently not exempt. If a security ceases to be described in paragraph (1) at any time after it was identified as such under paragraph (2), subsection (a) shall apply to any changes in value of the security occurring after the cessation.\n  (4) Special rule for property held for investment. To the extent provided in regulations, subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) shall not apply to any security described in subparagraph (D) or (E) of subsection (c)(2) which is held by a dealer in such securities.\n(c) Definitions. For purposes of this section\u2014\n  (1) Dealer in securities defined. The term \u201cdealer in securities\u201d means a taxpayer who\u2014\n    (A) regularly purchases securities from or sells securities to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business; or\n    (B) regularly offers to enter into, assume, offset, assign or otherwise terminate positions in securities with customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.\n  (2) Security defined. The term \u201csecurity\u201d means any\u2014\n    (A) share of stock in a corporation;\n    (B) partnership or beneficial ownership interest in a widely held or publicly traded partnership or trust;\n    (C) note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness;\n    (D) interest rate, currency, or equity notional principal contract;\n    (E) evidence of an interest in, or a derivative financial instrument in, any security described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D), or any currency, including any option, forward contract, short position, and any similar financial instrument in such a security or currency; and\n    (F) position which\u2014\n      (i) is not a security described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E),\n      (ii) is a hedge with respect to such a security, and\n      (iii) is clearly identified in the dealer\u2019s records as being described in this subparagraph before the close of the day on which it was acquired or entered into (or such other time as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe).\n  Subparagraph (E) shall not include any contract to which section 1256(a) applies.\n  (3) Hedge. The term \u201chedge\u201d means any position which manages the dealer\u2019s risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations, including any position which is reasonably expected to become a hedge within 60 days after the acquisition of the position.\n  (4) Special rules for certain receivables.\n    (A) In general.

For purposes of this section\u2014\n  (1) Coordination with certain rules. The rules of sections 263(g), 263A, and 1256(a) shall not apply to securities to which subsection (a) applies, and section 1091 shall not apply (and section 1092 shall apply) to any loss recognized under subsection (a).\n  (2) Improper identification. If a taxpayer\u2014\n    (A) identifies any security under subsection (b)(2) as being described in subsection (b)(1) and such security is not so described, or\n    (B) fails under subsection (c)(2)(F)(iii) to identify any position which is described in subsection (c)(2)(F) (without regard to clause (iii) thereof) at the time such identification is required,\n  the provisions of subsection (a) shall apply to such security or position, except that any loss under this section prior to the disposition of the security or position shall be recognized only to the extent of gain previously recognized under this section (and not previously taken into account under this paragraph) with respect to such security or position.\n  (3) Character of gain or loss.\n    (A) In general.

If\u2014\n        (I) gain or loss is recognized with respect to a security before the close of the taxable year, and\n        (II) subsection (a)(2) would have applied if the security were held as of the close of the taxable year,\n    \u2001such gain or loss shall be treated as ordinary income or loss.\n    (B) Exception. Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any gain or loss which is allocable to a period during which\u2014\n      (i) the security is described in subsection (b)(1)(C) (without regard to subsection (b)(2)),\n      (ii) the security is held by a person other than in connection with its activities as a dealer in securities, or\n      (iii) the security is improperly identified (within the meaning of subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2)).\n(e) Election of mark to market for dealers in commodities.\n  (1) In general. In the case of a dealer in commodities who elects the application of this subsection, this section shall apply to commodities held by such dealer in the same manner as this section applies to securities held by a dealer in securities.\n  (2) Commodity. For purposes of this subsection and subsection (f), the term \u201ccommodity\u201d means\u2014\n    (A) any commodity which is actively traded (within the meaning of section 1092(d)(1));\n    (B) any notional principal contract with respect to any commodity described in subparagraph (A);\n    (C) any evidence of an interest in, or a derivative instrument in, any commodity described in subparagraph (A) or (B), including any option, forward contract, futures contract, short position, and any similar instrument in such a commodity; and\n    (D) any position which\u2014\n      (i) is not a commodity described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C),\n      (ii) is a hedge with respect to such a commodity, and\n      (iii) is clearly identified in the taxpayer\u2019s records as being described in this subparagraph before the close of the day on which it was acquired or entered into (or such other time as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe).\n  (3) Election. An election under this subsection may be made without the consent of the Secretary. Such an election, once made, shall apply to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary.\n(f) Election of mark to market for traders in securities or commodities.\n  (1) Traders in securities.\n    (A) In general. In the case of a person who is engaged in a trade or business as a trader in securities and who elects to have this paragraph apply to such trade or business\u2014\n      (i) such person shall recognize gain or loss on any security held in connection with such trade or business at the close of any taxable year as if such security were sold for its fair market value on the last business day of such taxable year, and\n      (ii) any gain or loss shall be taken into account for such taxable year.\n    Proper adjustment shall be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain or loss taken into account under the preceding sentence. The Secretary may provide by regulations for the application of this subparagraph at times other than the times provided in this subparagraph.\n    (B) Exception. Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any security\u2014\n      (i) which is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary as having no connection to the activities of such person as a trader, and\n      (ii) which is clearly identified in such person\u2019s records as being described in clause (i) before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into (or such other time as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe).\n    If a security ceases to be described in clause (i) at any time after it was identified as such under clause (ii), subparagraph (A) shall apply to any changes in value of the security occurring after the cessation.\n    (C) Coordination with section 1259. Any security to which subparagraph (A) applies and which was acquired in the normal course of the taxpayer\u2019s activities as a trader in securities shall not be taken into account in applying section 1259 to any position to which subparagraph (A) does not apply.\n    (D) Other rules to apply. Rules similar to the rules of subsections (b)(4) and (d) shall apply to securities held by a person in any trade or business with respect to which an election under this paragraph is in effect. Subsection (d)(3) shall not apply under the preceding sentence for purposes of applying sections 1402 and 7704.\n  (2) Traders in commodities. In the case of a person who is engaged in a trade or business as a trader in commodities and who elects to have this paragraph apply to such trade or business, paragraph (1) shall apply to commodities held by such trader in connection with such trade or business in the same manner as paragraph (1) applies to securities held by a trader in securities.\n  (3) Election. The elections under paragraphs (1) and (2) may be made separately for each trade or business and without the consent of the Secretary. Such an election, once made, shall apply to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary.\n(g) Regulatory authority. The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section, including rules\u2014\n  (1) to prevent the use of year-end transfers, related parties, or other arrangements to avoid the provisions of this section,\n  (2) to provide for the application of this section to any security which is a hedge which cannot be identified with a specific security, position, right to income, or liability, and\n  (3) to prevent the use by taxpayers of subsection (c)(4) to avoid the application of this section to a receivable that is inventory in the hands of the taxpayer (or a person who bears a relationship to the taxpayer described in section 267(b) or 707(b)).\n\nWhat is the exact citation above where the term \"commodity\" is defined?

Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary may provide that a type of insurance contract will be treated as a separate category for purposes of this section (and prescribe a percentage applicable to such category) if the Secretary determines that the deferral of acquisition expenses for such type of contract which would otherwise result under this section is substantially greater than the deferral of acquisition expenses which would have resulted if actual acquisition expenses (including indirect expenses) and the actual useful life for such type of contract had been used.\n  (2) Adjustment to other contracts. If the Secretary exercises his authority with respect to any type of contract under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall adjust the percentage which would otherwise have applied under subsection (c)(1) to the category which includes such type of contract so that the exercise of such authority does not result in a decrease in the amount of revenue received under this chapter by reason of this section for any fiscal year.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above where the term \"group life insurance contract\" is defined?

In addition to the broadcast signals that subscribers may receive under section 338 and 339 of this title, a satellite carrier is also authorized to retransmit to a subscriber located in a community the signal of any station located outside the local market in which such subscriber is located, to the extent such signal\u2014\n  (1) has, before December 8, 2004, been determined by the Federal Communications Commission to be a signal a cable operator may carry as significantly viewed in such community, except to the extent that such signal is prevented from being carried by a cable system in such community under the Commission\u2019s network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity rules; or\n  (2) is, after December 8, 2004, determined by the Commission to be significantly viewed in such community in accordance with the same standards and procedures concerning shares of viewing hours and audience surveys as are applicable under the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Commission to determining with respect to a cable system whether signals are significantly viewed in a community.\n(b) Limitations.\n  (1) Service limited to subscribers taking local-into-local service. This section shall apply only to retransmissions to subscribers of a satellite carrier who receive retransmissions of a signal from that satellite carrier pursuant to section 338 of this title.\n  (2) Service limitations. A satellite carrier may retransmit to a subscriber in high definition format the signal of a station determined by the Commission to be significantly viewed under subsection (a) only if such carrier also retransmits in high definition format the signal of a station located in the local market of such subscriber and affiliated with the same network whenever such format is available from such station.\n  (3) Limitation not applicable where no network affiliates. The limitations in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prohibit a retransmission under this section to a subscriber located in a local market in which there are no network stations affiliated with the same television network as the station whose signal is being retransmitted pursuant to this section.\n  (4) Authority to grant station-specific waivers. Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prohibit a retransmission of a network station to a subscriber if and to the extent that the network station in the local market in which the subscriber is located, and that is affiliated with the same television network, has privately negotiated and affirmatively granted a waiver from the requirements of paragraph (1) and (2) to such satellite carrier with respect to retransmission of the significantly viewed station to such subscriber.\n(c) Publication and modifications of lists; regulations.\n  (1) In general. The Commission shall\u2014\n    (A) within 60 days after December 8, 2004\u2014\n      (i) publish a list of the stations that are eligible for retransmission under subsection (a)(1) and the communities in which such stations are eligible for such retransmission; and\n      (ii) commence a rulemaking proceeding to implement this section by publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking;\n    (B) adopt rules pursuant to such rulemaking within 1 year after December 8, 2004.\n  (2) Public availability of list. The Commission shall make readily available to the public in electronic form, on the Internet website of the Commission or other comparable facility, a list of the stations that are eligible for retransmission under subsection (a) and the communities in which such stations are eligible for such retransmission. The Commission shall update such list within 10 business days after the date on which the Commission issues an order making any modification of such stations and communities.\n  (3) Modifications. In addition to cable operators and television broadcast station licensees, the Commission shall permit a satellite carrier to petition for decisions and orders\u2014\n    (A) by which stations may be added to those that are eligible for retransmission under subsection (a), and by which communities may be added in which such stations are eligible for such retransmission; and\n    (B) by which network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity regulations are applied to the retransmission in accordance with subsection (e).\n(d) Effect on other obligations and rights.\n  (1) No effect on carriage obligations. Carriage of a signal under this section is not mandatory, and any right of a station licensee to have the signal of such station carried under section 338 of this title is not affected by the eligibility of such station to be carried under this section.\n  (2) Retransmission consent rights not affected. The eligibility of the signal of a station to be carried under this section does not affect any right of the licensee of such station to grant (or withhold) retransmission consent under section 325(b)(1) of this title.\n(e) Network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity.\n  (1) Not applicable except as provided by commission regulations. Signals eligible to be carried under this section are not subject to the Commission\u2019s regulations concerning network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity unless, pursuant to regulations adopted by the Commission, the Commission determines to permit network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity to apply within the appropriate zone of protection.\n  (2) Limitation. Nothing in this subsection or Commission regulations shall permit the application of network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity regulations to the retransmission of distant signals of network stations that are carried by a satellite carrier pursuant to a statutory license under section 119(a)(2)(A) or (B) of title 17, with respect to persons who reside in unserved households, under 119(a)(4)(A), or under section 119(a)(12), of such title.\n(f) Enforcement.\n  (1) Orders and damages. Upon complaint, the Commission shall issue a cease and desist order to any satellite carrier found to have violated this section in carrying any television broadcast station. Such order may, if a complaining station requests damages\u2014\n    (A) provide for the award of damages to a complaining station that establishes that the violation was committed in bad faith, in an amount up to $50 per subscriber, per station, per day of the violation; and\n    (B) provide for the award of damages to a prevailing satellite carrier if the Commission determines that the complaint was frivolous, in an amount up to $50 per subscriber alleged to be in violation, per station alleged, per day of the alleged violation.\n  (2) Commission decision. The Commission shall issue a final determination resolving a complaint brought under this subsection not later than 180 days after the submission of a complaint under this subsection. The Commission may hear witnesses if it clearly appears, based on written filings by the parties, that there is a genuine dispute about material facts. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Commission may issue a final ruling based on written filings by the parties.\n  (3) Remedies in addition. The remedies under this subsection are in addition to any remedies available under title 17.\n  (4) No effect on copyright proceedings. Any determination, action, or failure to act of the Commission under this subsection shall have no effect on any proceeding under title 17 and shall not be introduced in evidence in any proceeding under that title. In no instance shall a Commission enforcement proceeding under this subsection be required as a predicate to the pursuit of a remedy available under title 17.\n(g) Notices concerning significantly viewed stations. Each satellite carrier that proposes to commence the retransmission of a station pursuant to this section in any local market shall\u2014\n  (1) not less than 60 days before commencing such retransmission, provide a written notice to any television broadcast station in such local market of such proposal; and\n  (2) designate on such carrier\u2019s website all significantly viewed signals carried pursuant to section 340 of this title and the communities in which the signals are carried.\n(h) Additional corresponding changes in regulations.\n  (1) Community-by-community elections. The Commission shall, no later than October 30, 2005, revise section 76.66 of its regulations (47 CFR 76.66), concerning satellite broadcast signal carriage, to permit (at the next cycle of elections under section 325 of this title) a television broadcast station that is located in a local market into which a satellite carrier retransmits a television broadcast station pursuant to section 338 of this title, to elect, with respect to such satellite carrier, between retransmission consent pursuant to such section 325 of this title and mandatory carriage pursuant to section 338 of this title separately for each county within such station\u2019s local market, if\u2014\n    (A) the satellite carrier has notified the station, pursuant to paragraph (3), that it intends to carry another affiliate of the same network pursuant to this section during the relevant election period in the station\u2019s local market; or\n    (B) on the date notification under paragraph (3) was due, the satellite carrier was retransmitting into the station\u2019s local market pursuant to this section an affiliate of the same television network.\n  (2) Unified negotiations. In revising its regulations as required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall provide that any such station shall conduct a unified negotiation for the entire portion of its local market for which retransmission consent is elected.\n  (3) Additional provisions. The Commission shall, no later than October 30, 2005, revise its regulations to provide the following:\n    (A) Notifications by satellite carrier. A satellite carrier\u2019s retransmission of television broadcast stations pursuant to this section shall be subject to the following limitations:\n      (i) In any local market in which the satellite carrier provides service pursuant to section 338 of this title on December 8, 2004, the carrier may notify a television broadcast station in that market, at least 60 days prior to any date on which the station must thereafter make an election under section 76.66 of the Commission\u2019s regulations (47 CFR 76.66), of\u2014\n        (I) each affiliate of the same television network that the carrier reserves the right to retransmit into that station\u2019s local market pursuant to this section during the next election cycle under such section of such regulations; and\n        (II) for each such affiliate, the communities into which the satellite carrier reserves the right to make such retransmissions.\n      (ii) In any local market in which the satellite carrier commences service pursuant to section 338 of this title after December 8, 2004, the carrier may notify a station in that market, at least 60 days prior to the introduction of such service in that market, and thereafter at least 60 days prior to any date on which the station must thereafter make an election under section 76.66 of the Commission\u2019s regulations (47 CFR 76.66), of each affiliate of the same television network that the carrier reserves the right to retransmit into that station\u2019s local market during the next election cycle under such section of such regulations.\n      (iii) Beginning with the 2005 election cycle, a satellite carrier may only retransmit pursuant to this section during the pertinent election period a signal\u2014\n        (I) as to which it has provided the notifications set forth in clauses (i) and (ii); or\n        (II) that it was retransmitting into the local market under this section as of the date such notifications were due.\n    (B) Harmonization of elections and retransmission consent agreements. If a satellite carrier notifies a television broadcast station that it reserves the right to retransmit an affiliate of the same television network during the next election cycle pursuant to this section, the station may choose between retransmission consent and mandatory carriage for any portion of the 3-year election cycle that is not covered by an existing retransmission consent agreement.\n(i) Definitions.

Nonroad engines and vehicles.\n(a) Emissions standards.\n  (1) The Administrator shall conduct a study of emissions from nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles (other than locomotives or engines used in locomotives) to determine if such emissions cause, or significantly contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Such study shall be completed within 12 months of November 15, 1990.\n  (2) After notice and opportunity for public hearing, the Administrator shall determine within 12 months after completion of the study under paragraph (1), based upon the results of such study, whether emissions of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and volatile organic compounds from new and existing nonroad engines or nonroad vehicles (other than locomotives or engines used in locomotives) are significant contributors to ozone or carbon monoxide concentrations in more than 1 area which has failed to attain the national ambient air quality standards for ozone or carbon monoxide. Such determination shall be included in the regulations under paragraph (3).\n  (3) If the Administrator makes an affirmative determination under paragraph (2) the Administrator shall, within 12 months after completion of the study under paragraph (1), promulgate (and from time to time revise) regulations containing standards applicable to emissions from those classes or categories of new nonroad engines and new nonroad vehicles (other than locomotives or engines used in locomotives) which in the Administrator\u2019s judgment cause, or contribute to, such air pollution. Such standards shall achieve the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through the application of technology which the Administrator determines will be available for the engines or vehicles to which such standards apply, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of applying such technology within the period of time available to manufacturers and to noise, energy, and safety factors associated with the application of such technology. In determining what degree of reduction will be available, the Administrator shall first consider standards equivalent in stringency to standards for comparable motor vehicles or engines (if any) regulated under section 7521 of this title, taking into account the technological feasibility, costs, safety, noise, and energy factors associated with achieving, as appropriate, standards of such stringency and lead time. The regulations shall apply to the useful life of the engines or vehicles (as determined by the Administrator).\n  (4) If the Administrator determines that any emissions not referred to in paragraph (2) from new nonroad engines or vehicles significantly contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, the Administrator may promulgate (and from time to time revise) such regulations as the Administrator deems appropriate containing standards applicable to emissions from those classes or categories of new nonroad engines and new nonroad vehicles (other than locomotives or engines used in locomotives) which in the Administrator\u2019s judgment cause, or contribute to, such air pollution, taking into account costs, noise, safety, and energy factors associated with the application of technology which the Administrator determines will be available for the engines and vehicles to which such standards apply. The regulations shall apply to the useful life of the engines or vehicles (as determined by the Administrator).\n  (5) Within 5 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations containing standards applicable to emissions from new locomotives and new engines used in locomotives. Such standards shall achieve the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through the application of technology which the Administrator determines will be available for the locomotives or engines to which such standards apply, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of applying such technology within the period of time available to manufacturers and to noise, energy, and safety factors associated with the application of such technology.\n(b) Effective date. Standards under this section shall take effect at the earliest possible date considering the lead time necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period and energy and safety.\n(c) Safe controls. Effective with respect to new engines or vehicles to which standards under this section apply, no emission control device, system, or element of design shall be used in such a new nonroad engine or new nonroad vehicle for purposes of complying with such standards if such device, system, or element of design will cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function. In determining whether an unreasonable risk exists, the Administrator shall consider factors including those described in section 7521(a)(4)(B) of this title.\n(d) Enforcement. The standards under this section shall be subject to sections 7525, 7541, 7542, and 7543 of this title, with such modifications of the applicable regulations implementing such sections as the Administrator deems appropriate, and shall be enforced in the same manner as standards prescribed under section 7521 of this title. The Administrator shall revise or promulgate regulations as may be necessary to determine compliance with, and enforce, standards in effect under this section.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above where the term \"student\" is defined?

The Secretary of Labor (in this section referred to as the \u201cSecretary\u201d) shall award grants under this section for a fiscal year to eligible States to conduct a program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments for individuals referred to reemployment services as described in section 503(j) of this title for weeks in such fiscal year for which such individuals receive unemployment compensation.\n(b) Purposes. The purposes of this section are to accomplish the following goals:\n  (1) To improve employment outcomes of individuals that receive unemployment compensation and to reduce the average duration of receipt of such compensation through employment.\n  (2) To strengthen program integrity and reduce improper payments of unemployment compensation by States through the detection and prevention of such payments to individuals who are not eligible for such compensation.\n  (3) To promote alignment with the broader vision of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) of increased program integration and service delivery for job seekers, including claimants for unemployment compensation.\n  (4) To establish reemployment services and eligibility assessments as an entry point for individuals receiving unemployment compensation into other workforce system partner programs.\n(c) Evidence-based standards.\n  (1) In general. In carrying out a State program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments using grant funds awarded to the State under this section, a State shall use such funds only for interventions demonstrated to reduce the number of weeks for which program participants receive unemployment compensation by improving employment outcomes for program participants.\n  (2) Expanding evidence-based interventions. In addition to the requirement imposed by paragraph (1), a State shall\u2014\n    (A) for fiscal years 2023 and 2024, use no less than 25 percent of the grant funds awarded to the State under this section for interventions with a high or moderate causal evidence rating that show a demonstrated capacity to improve employment and earnings outcomes for program participants;\n    (B) for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, use no less than 40 percent of such grant funds for interventions described in subparagraph (A); and\n    (C) for fiscal years beginning after fiscal year 2026, use no less than 50 percent of such grant funds for interventions described in subparagraph (A).\n(d) Evaluations.\n  (1) Required evaluations. Any intervention without a high or moderate causal evidence rating used by a State in carrying out a State program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments under this section shall be under evaluation at the time of use.\n  (2) Funding limitation. A State shall use not more than 10 percent of grant funds awarded to the State under this section to conduct or cause to be conducted evaluations of interventions used in carrying out a program under this section (including evaluations conducted pursuant to paragraph (1)).\n(e) State plan.\n  (1) In general. As a condition of eligibility to receive a grant under this section for a fiscal year, a State shall submit to the Secretary, at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may require, a State plan that outlines how the State intends to conduct a program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments under this section, including\u2014\n    (A) assurances that, and a description of how, the program will provide\u2014\n      (i) proper notification to participating individuals of the program\u2019s eligibility conditions, requirements, and benefits, including the issuance of warnings and simple, clear notifications to ensure that participating individuals are fully aware of the consequences of failing to adhere to such requirements, including policies related to non-attendance or non-fulfillment of work search requirements; and\n      (ii) reasonable scheduling accommodations to maximize participation for eligible individuals;\n    (B) assurances that, and a description of how, the program will conform with the purposes outlined in subsection (b) and satisfy the requirement to use evidence-based standards under subsection (c), including\u2014\n      (i) a description of the evidence-based interventions the State plans to use to speed reemployment;\n      (ii) an explanation of how such interventions are appropriate to the population served; and\n      (iii) if applicable, a description of the evaluation structure the State plans to use for interventions without at least a moderate or high causal evidence rating, which may include national evaluations conducted by the Department of Labor or by other entities; and\n    (C) a description of any reemployment activities and evaluations conducted in the prior fiscal year, and any data collected on\u2014\n      (i) characteristics of program participants;\n      (ii) the number of weeks for which program participants receive unemployment compensation; and\n      (iii) employment and other outcomes for program participants consistent with State performance accountability measures provided by the State unemployment compensation program and in section 116(b) of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3141(b)).\n  (2) Approval. The Secretary shall approve any State plan, that is timely submitted to the Secretary, in such manner as the Secretary may require, that satisfies the conditions described in paragraph (1).\n  (3) Disapproval and revision. If the Secretary determines that a State plan submitted pursuant to this subsection fails to satisfy the conditions described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall\u2014\n    (A) disapprove such plan;\n    (B) provide to the State, not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the State plan, a written notice of such disapproval that includes a description of any portion of the plan that was not approved and the reason for the disapproval of each such portion; and\n    (C) provide the State with an opportunity to correct any such failure and submit a revised State plan.\n(f) Allocation of funds.\n  (1) Base funding.\n    (A) In general. For each fiscal year after fiscal year 2020, the Secretary shall allocate a percentage equal to the base funding percentage for such fiscal year of the funds made available for grants under this section among the States awarded such a grant for such fiscal year using a formula prescribed by the Secretary based on the rate of insured unemployment (as defined in section 203(e)(1) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note)) in the State for a period to be determined by the Secretary. In developing such formula with respect to a State, the Secretary shall consider the importance of avoiding sharp reductions in grant funding to a State over time.\n    (B) Base funding percentage. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term \u201cbase funding percentage\u201d means\u2014\n      (i) for fiscal years 2021 through 2026, 89 percent; and\n      (ii) for fiscal years after 2026, 84 percent.\n  (2) Reservation for outcome payments.\n    (A) In general. Of the amounts made available for grants under this section for each fiscal year after 2020, the Secretary shall reserve a percentage equal to the outcome reservation percentage for such fiscal year for outcome payments to increase the amount otherwise awarded to a State under paragraph (1). Such outcome payments shall be paid to States conducting reemployment services and eligibility assessments under this section that, during the previous fiscal year, met or exceeded the outcome goals provided in subsection (b)(1) related to reducing the average duration of receipt of unemployment compensation by improving employment outcomes.\n    (B) Outcome reservation percentage. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term \u201coutcome reservation percentage\u201d means\u2014\n      (i) for fiscal years 2021 through 2026, 10 percent; and\n      (ii) for fiscal years after 2026, 15 percent.\n  (3) Reservation for research and technical assistance.

Not later than September 30, 2019, the Secretary shall\u2014\n    (A) consult with the States and seek public comment in developing the allocation formula under paragraph (1) and the criteria for carrying out the reservations under paragraph (2); and\n    (B) make publicly available the allocation formula and criteria developed pursuant to subclause (A).\n(g) Notification to Congress. Not later than 90 days prior to making any changes to the allocation formula or the criteria developed pursuant to subsection (f)(5)(A), the Secretary shall submit to Congress, including to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, a notification of any such change.\n(h) Supplement not supplant. Funds made available to carry out this section shall be used to supplement the level of Federal, State, and local public funds that, in the absence of such availability, would be expended to provide reemployment services and eligibility assessments to individuals receiving unemployment compensation, and in no case to supplant such Federal, State, or local public funds.\n(i) Definitions. In this section:\n  (1) Causal evidence rating.

If for any taxable year beginning in the recognition period an S corporation has a net recognized built-in gain, there is hereby imposed a tax (computed under subsection (b)) on the income of such corporation for such taxable year.\n(b) Amount of tax.\n  (1) In general. The amount of the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be computed by applying the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b) to the net recognized built-in gain of the S corporation for the taxable year.\n  (2) Net operating loss carryforwards from C years allowed. Notwithstanding section 1371(b)(1), any net operating loss carryforward arising in a taxable year for which the corporation was a C corporation shall be allowed for purposes of this section as a deduction against the net recognized built-in gain of the S corporation for the taxable year. For purposes of determining the amount of any such loss which may be carried to subsequent taxable years, the amount of the net recognized built-in gain shall be treated as taxable income. Rules similar to the rules of the preceding sentences of this paragraph shall apply in the case of a capital loss carryforward arising in a taxable year for which the corporation was a C corporation.\n  (3) Credits.\n    (A) In general. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no credit shall be allowable under part IV of subchapter A of this chapter (other than under section 34) against the tax imposed by subsection (a).\n    (B) Business credit carryforwards from C years allowed. Notwithstanding section 1371(b)(1), any business credit carryforward under section 39 arising in a taxable year for which the corporation was a C corporation shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by subsection (a) in the same manner as if it were imposed by section 11.\n(c) Limitations.\n  (1) Corporations which were always S corporations. Subsection (a) shall not apply to any corporation if an election under section 1362(a) has been in effect with respect to such corporation for each of its taxable years. Except as provided in regulations, an S corporation and any predecessor corporation shall be treated as 1 corporation for purposes of the preceding sentence.\n  (2) Limitation on amount of net recognized built-in gain. The amount of the net recognized built-in gain taken into account under this section for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of\u2014\n    (A) the net unrealized built-in gain, over\n    (B) the net recognized built-in gain for prior taxable years beginning in the recognition period.\n(d) Definitions and special rules. For purposes of this section\u2014\n  (1) Net unrealized built-in gain. The term \u201cnet unrealized built-in gain\u201d means the amount (if any) by which\u2014\n    (A) the fair market value of the assets of the S corporation as of the beginning of its 1st taxable year for which an election under section 1362(a) is in effect, exceeds\n    (B) the aggregate adjusted bases of such assets at such time.\n  (2) Net recognized built-in gain.\n    (A) In general. The term \u201cnet recognized built-in gain\u201d means, with respect to any taxable year in the recognition period, the lesser of\u2014\n      (i) the amount which would be the taxable income of the S corporation for such taxable year if only recognized built-in gains and recognized built-in losses were taken into account, or\n      (ii) such corporation\u2019s taxable income for such taxable year (determined as provided in section 1375(b)(1)(B)).\n    (B) Carryover. If, for any taxable year described in subparagraph (A), the amount referred to in clause (i) of subparagraph (A) exceeds the amount referred to in clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), such excess shall be treated as a recognized built-in gain in the succeeding taxable year.\n  (3) Recognized built-in gain. The term \u201crecognized built-in gain\u201d means any gain recognized during the recognition period on the disposition of any asset except to the extent that the S corporation establishes that\u2014\n    (A) such asset was not held by the S corporation as of the beginning of the 1st taxable year for which it was an S corporation, or\n    (B) such gain exceeds the excess (if any) of\u2014\n      (i) the fair market value of such asset as of the beginning of such 1st taxable year, over\n      (ii) the adjusted basis of the asset as of such time.\n  (4) Recognized built-in losses. The term \u201crecognized built-in loss\u201d means any loss recognized during the recognition period on the disposition of any asset to the extent that the S corporation establishes that\u2014\n    (A) such asset was held by the S corporation as of the beginning of the 1st taxable year referred to in paragraph (3), and\n    (B) such loss does not exceed the excess of\u2014\n      (i) the adjusted basis of such asset as of the beginning of such 1st taxable year, over\n      (ii) the fair market value of such asset as of such time.\n  (5) Treatment of certain built-in items.\n    (A) Income items. Any item of income which is properly taken into account during the recognition period but which is attributable to periods before the 1st taxable year for which the corporation was an S corporation shall be treated as a recognized built-in gain for the taxable year in which it is properly taken into account.\n    (B) Deduction items. Any amount which is allowable as a deduction during the recognition period (determined without regard to any carryover) but which is attributable to periods before the 1st taxable year referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be treated as a recognized built-in loss for the taxable year for which it is allowable as a deduction.\n    (C) Adjustment to net unrealized built-in gain. The amount of the net unrealized built-in gain shall be properly adjusted for amounts which would be treated as recognized built-in gains or losses under this paragraph if such amounts were properly taken into account (or allowable as a deduction) during the recognition period.\n  (6) Treatment of certain property. If the adjusted basis of any asset is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the adjusted basis of any other asset held by the S corporation as of the beginning of the 1st taxable year referred to in paragraph (3)\u2014\n    (A) such asset shall be treated as held by the S corporation as of the beginning of such 1st taxable year, and\n    (B) any determination under paragraph (3)(B) or (4)(B) with respect to such asset shall be made by reference to the fair market value and adjusted basis of such other asset as of the beginning of such 1st taxable year.\n  (7) Recognition period.\n    (A) In general. The term \u201crecognition period\u201d means the 5-year period beginning with the 1st day of the 1st taxable year for which the corporation was an S corporation. For purposes of applying this section to any amount includible in income by reason of distributions to shareholders pursuant to section 593(e), the preceding sentence shall be applied without regard to the phrase \u201c5-year\u201d.\n    (B) Installment sales. If an S corporation sells an asset and reports the income from the sale using the installment method under section 453, the treatment of all payments received shall be governed by the provisions of this paragraph applicable to the taxable year in which such sale was made.\n  (8) Treatment of transfer of assets from C corporation to S corporation.\n    (A) In general. Except to the extent provided in regulations, if\u2014\n      (i) an S corporation acquires any asset, and\n      (ii) the S corporation\u2019s basis in such asset is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the basis of such asset (or any other property) in the hands of a C corporation,\n    then a tax is hereby imposed on any net recognized built-in gain attributable to any such assets for any taxable year beginning in the recognition period. The amount of such tax shall be determined under the rules of this section as modified by subparagraph (B).\n    (B) Modifications. For purposes of this paragraph, the modifications of this subparagraph are as follows:\n      (i) In general. The preceding paragraphs of this subsection shall be applied by taking into account the day on which the assets were acquired by the S corporation in lieu of the beginning of the 1st taxable year for which the corporation was an S corporation.\n      (ii) Subsection (c)(1) not to apply. Subsection (c)(1) shall not apply.\n  (9) Reference to 1st taxable year.

If a levy has been made on property or property has been sold pursuant to a levy, any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in or lien on such property and that such property was wrongfully levied upon may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States. Such action may be brought without regard to whether such property has been surrendered to or sold by the Secretary.\n  (2) Surplus proceeds. If property has been sold pursuant to a levy, any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in or lien on such property junior to that of the United States and to be legally entitled to the surplus proceeds of such sale may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States.\n  (3) Substituted sale proceeds. If property has been sold pursuant to an agreement described in section 6325(b)(3) (relating to substitution of proceeds of sale), any person who claims to be legally entitled to all or any part of the amount held as a fund pursuant to such agreement may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States.\n  (4) Substitution of value. If a certificate of discharge is issued to any person under section 6325(b)(4) with respect to any property, such person may, within 120 days after the day on which such certificate is issued, bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States for a determination of whether the value of the interest of the United States (if any) in such property is less than the value determined by the Secretary. No other action may be brought by such person for such a determination.\n(b) Adjudication. The district court shall have jurisdiction to grant only such of the following forms of relief as may be appropriate in the circumstances:\n  (1) Injunction. If a levy or sale would irreparably injure rights in property which the court determines to be superior to rights of the United States in such property, the court may grant an injunction to prohibit the enforcement of such levy or to prohibit such sale.\n  (2) Recovery of property. If the court determines that such property has been wrongfully levied upon, the court may\u2014\n    (A) order the return of specific property if the United States is in possession of such property;\n    (B) grant a judgment for the amount of money levied upon; or\n    (C) if such property was sold, grant a judgment for an amount not exceeding the greater of\u2014\n      (i) the amount received by the United States from the sale of such property, or\n      (ii) the fair market value of such property immediately before the levy.\n  For the purposes of subparagraph (C), if the property was declared purchased by the United States at a sale pursuant to section 6335(e) (relating to manner and conditions of sale), the United States shall be treated as having received an amount equal to the minimum price determined pursuant to such section or (if larger) the amount received by the United States from the resale of such property.\n  (3) Surplus proceeds. If the court determines that the interest or lien of any party to an action under this section was transferred to the proceeds of a sale of such property, the court may grant a judgment in an amount equal to all or any part of the amount of the surplus proceeds of such sale.\n  (4) Substituted sale proceeds. If the court determines that a party has an interest in or lien on the amount held as a fund pursuant to an agreement described in section 6325(b)(3) (relating to substitution of proceeds of sale), the court may grant a judgment in an amount equal to all or any part of the amount of such fund.\n  (5) Substitution of value. If the court determines that the Secretary\u2019s determination of the value of the interest of the United States in the property for purposes of section 6325(b)(4) exceeds the actual value of such interest, the court shall grant a judgment ordering a refund of the amount deposited, and a release of the bond, to the extent that the aggregate of the amounts thereof exceeds such value determined by the court.\n(c) Validity of assessment. For purposes of an adjudication under this section, the assessment of tax upon which the interest or lien of the United States is based shall be conclusively presumed to be valid.\n(d) Limitation on rights of action. No action may be maintained against any officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative with respect to any acts for which an action could be maintained under this section.\n(e) Substitution of United States as party. If an action, which could be brought against the United States under this section, is improperly brought against any officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative, the court shall order, upon such terms as are just, that the pleadings be amended to substitute the United States as a party for such officer or employee as of the time such action was commenced upon proper service of process on the United States.\n(f) Provision inapplicable. The provisions of section 7422(a) (relating to prohibition of suit prior to filing claim for refund) shall not apply to actions under this section.\n(g) Interest. Interest shall be allowed at the overpayment rate established under section 6621\u2014\n  (1) in the case of a judgment pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(B), from the date the Secretary receives the money wrongfully levied upon to the date of payment of such judgment;\n  (2) in the case of a judgment pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(C), from the date of the sale of the property wrongfully levied upon to the date of payment of such judgment; and\n  (3) in the case of a judgment pursuant to subsection (b)(5) which orders a refund of any amount, from the date the Secretary received such amount to the date of payment of such judgment.\n(h) Recovery of damages permitted in certain cases.\n  (1) In general. Notwithstanding subsection (b), if, in any action brought under this section, there is a finding that any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service recklessly or intentionally, or by reason of negligence, disregarded any provision of this title the defendant shall be liable to the plaintiff in an amount equal to the lesser of $1,000,000 ($100,000 in the case of negligence) or the sum of\u2014\n    (A) actual, direct economic damages sustained by the plaintiff as a proximate result of the reckless or intentional or negligent disregard of any provision of this title by the officer or employee (reduced by any amount of such damages awarded under subsection (b)); and\n    (B) the costs of the action.\n  (2) Requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted; mitigation; period. The rules of section 7433(d) shall apply for purposes of this subsection.\n  (3) Payment authority. Claims pursuant to this section shall be payable out of funds appropriated under section 1304 of title 31, United States Code.\n(i) Cross reference.

{"id": "test4k_usc_def2c_49", "task": "defined2cite", "texttype": "uscode", "prompt": "\u00a7 1212. Capital loss carrybacks and carryovers.\n(a) Corporations.\n  (1) In general. If a corporation has a net capital loss for any taxable year (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the \u201closs year\u201d), the amount thereof shall be\u2014\n    (A) a capital loss carryback to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year, but only to the extent\u2014\n      (i) such loss is not attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss, and\n      (ii) the carryback of such loss does not increase or produce a net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for the taxable year to which it is being carried back;\n    (B) except as provided in subparagraph (C), a capital loss carryover to each of the 5 taxable years succeeding the loss year; and\n    (C) a capital loss carryover to each of the 10 taxable years succeeding the loss year, but only to the extent such loss is attributable to a foreign expropriation loss,\n  and shall be treated as a short-term capital loss in each such taxable year. The entire amount of the net capital loss for any taxable year shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which such loss may be carried, and the portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years to which such loss may be carried shall be the excess, if any, of such loss over the total of the capital gain net income for each of the prior taxable years to which such loss may be carried. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the capital gain net income for any such prior taxable year shall be computed without regard to the net capital loss for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter. In the case of any net capital loss which cannot be carried back in full to a preceding taxable year by reason of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), the capital gain net income for such prior taxable year shall in no case be treated as greater than the amount of such loss which can be carried back to such preceding taxable year upon the application of such clause (ii).\n  (2) Definitions and special rules.\n    (A) Foreign expropriation capital loss defined. For purposes of this subsection, the term \u201cforeign expropriation capital loss\u201d means, for any taxable year, the sum of the losses taken into account in computing the net capital loss for such year which are\u2014\n      (i) losses sustained directly by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of property by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing, or\n      (ii) losses (treated under section 165(g)(1) as losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets) from securities which become worthless by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of property by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing.\n    (B) Portion of loss attributable to foreign expropriation capital loss. For purposes of paragraph (1), the portion of any net capital loss for any taxable year attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss is the amount of the foreign expropriation capital loss for such year (but not in excess of the net capital loss for such year).\n    (C) Priority of application. For purposes of paragraph (1), if a portion of a net capital loss for any taxable year is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss, such portion shall be considered to be a separate net capital loss for such year to be applied after the other portion of such net capital loss.\n  (3) Regulated investment companies.\n    (A) In general. If a regulated investment company has a net capital loss for any taxable year\u2014\n      (i) paragraph (1) shall not apply to such loss,\n      (ii) the excess of the net short-term capital loss over the net long-term capital gain for such year shall be a short-term capital loss arising on the first day of the next taxable year, and\n      (iii) the excess of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain for such year shall be a long-term capital loss arising on the first day of the next taxable year.\n    (B) Coordination with general rule. If a net capital loss to which paragraph (1) applies is carried over to a taxable year of a regulated investment company\u2014\n      (i) Losses to which this paragraph applies. Clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) shall be applied without regard to any amount treated as a short-term capital loss under paragraph (1).\n      (ii) Losses to which general rule applies. Paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting \u201cnet capital loss for the loss year or any taxable year thereafter (other than a net capital loss to which paragraph (3)(A) applies)\u201d for \u201cnet capital loss for the loss year or any taxable year thereafter\u201d.\n  (4) Special rules on carrybacks. A net capital loss of a corporation shall not be carried back under paragraph (1)(A) to a taxable year\u2014\n    (A) for which it is a regulated investment company (as defined in section 851), or\n    (B) for which it is a real estate investment trust (as defined in section 856).\n(b) Other taxpayers.\n  (1) In general. If a taxpayer other than a corporation has a net capital loss for any taxable year\u2014\n    (A) the excess of the net short-term capital loss over the net long-term capital gain for such year shall be a short-term capital loss in the succeeding taxable year, and\n    (B) the excess of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain for such year shall be a long-term capital loss in the succeeding taxable year.\n  (2) Treatment of amounts allowed under section 1211(b)(1) or (2).\n    (A) In general. For purposes of determining the excess referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), there shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in the taxable year an amount equal to the lesser of\u2014\n      (i) the amount allowed for the taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1211(b), or\n      (ii) the adjusted taxable income for such taxable year.\n    (B) Adjusted taxable income. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term \u201cadjusted taxable income\u201d means taxable income increased by the sum of\u2014\n      (i) the amount allowed for the taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1211(b), and\n      (ii) the deduction allowed for such year under section 151 or any deduction in lieu thereof.\n    For purposes of the preceding sentence, any excess of the deductions allowed for the taxable year over the gross income for such year shall be taken into account as negative taxable income.\n(c) Carryback of losses from section 1256 contracts to offset prior gains from such contracts.\n  (1) In general. If a taxpayer (other than a corporation) has a net section 1256 contracts loss for the taxable year and elects to have this subsection apply to such taxable year, the amount of such net section 1256 contracts loss\u2014\n    (A) shall be a carryback to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year, and\n    (B) to the extent that, after the application of paragraphs (2) and (3), such loss is allowed as a carryback to any such preceding taxable year\u2014\n      (i) 40 percent of the amount so allowed shall be treated as a short-term capital loss from section 1256 contracts, and\n      (ii) 60 percent of the amount so allowed shall be treated as a long-term capital loss from section 1256 contracts.\n  (2) Amount carried to each taxable year. The entire amount of the net section 1256 contracts loss for any taxable year shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which such loss may be carried back under paragraph (1). The portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the 2 other taxable years to which such loss may be carried back shall be the excess (if any) of such loss over the portion of such loss which, after the application of paragraph (3), was allowed as a carryback for any prior taxable year.\n  (3) Amount which may be used in any prior taxable year. An amount shall be allowed as a carryback under paragraph (1) to any prior taxable year only to the extent\u2014\n    (A) such amount does not exceed the net section 1256 contract gain for such year, and\n    (B) the allowance of such carryback does not increase or produce a net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for such year.\n  (4) Net section 1256 contracts loss. For purposes of paragraph (1), the term \u201cnet section 1256 contracts loss\u201d means the lesser of\u2014\n    (A) the net capital loss for the taxable year determined by taking into account only gains and losses from section 1256 contracts, or\n    (B) the sum of the amounts which, but for paragraph (6)(A), would be treated as capital losses in the succeeding taxable year under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (b)(1).\n  (5) Net section 1256 contract gain. For purposes of paragraph (1)\u2014\n    (A) In general. The term \u201cnet section 1256 contract gain\u201d means the lesser of\u2014\n      (i) the capital gain net income for the taxable year determined by taking into account only gains and losses from section 1256 contracts, or\n      (ii) the capital gain net income for the taxable year.\n    (B) Special rule. The net section 1256 contract gain for any taxable year before the loss year shall be computed without regard to the net section 1256 contracts loss for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter.\n  (6) Coordination with carryforward provisions of subsection (b)(1).\n    (A) Carryforward amount reduced by amount used as carryback. For purposes of applying subsection (b)(1), if any portion of the net section 1256 contracts loss for any taxable year is allowed as a carryback under paragraph (1) to any preceding taxable year\u2014\n      (i) 40 percent of the amount allowed as a carryback shall be treated as a short-term capital gain for the loss year, and\n      (ii) 60 percent of the amount allowed as a carryback shall be treated as a long-term capital gain for the loss year.\n    (B) Carryover loss retains character as attributable to section 1256 contract. Any amount carried forward as a short-term or long-term capital loss to any taxable year under subsection (b)(1) (after the application of subparagraph (A)) shall, to the extent attributable to losses from section 1256 contracts, be treated as loss from section 1256 contracts for such taxable year.\n  (7) Other definitions and special rules. For purposes of this subsection\u2014\n    (A) Section 1256 contract. The term \u201csection 1256 contract\u201d means any section 1256 contract (as defined in section 1256(b)) to which section 1256 applies.\n    (B) Exclusion for estates and trusts. This subsection shall not apply to any estate or trust.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above where the term \"section 1256 contract\" is defined?

Default of student under Federal loan insurance program.\n(a) Notice to Secretary and payment of loss. Upon default by the student borrower on any loan covered by Federal loan insurance pursuant to this part, and prior to the commencement of suit or other enforcement proceedings upon security for that loan, the insurance beneficiary shall promptly notify the Secretary, and the Secretary shall if requested (at that time or after further collection efforts) by the beneficiary, or may on the Secretary\u2019s own motion, if the insurance is still in effect, pay to the beneficiary the amount of the loss sustained by the insured upon that loan as soon as that amount has been determined. The \u201camount of the loss\u201d on any loan shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b), be deemed to be an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the principal amount and accrued interest, including interest accruing from the date of submission of a valid default claim (as determined by the Secretary) to the date on which payment is authorized by the Secretary, reduced to the extent required by section 1075(b) of this title. Such beneficiary shall be required to meet the standards of due diligence in the collection of the loan and shall be required to submit proof that the institution was contacted and other reasonable attempts were made to locate the borrower (when the location of the borrower is unknown) and proof that contact was made with the borrower (when the location is known). The Secretary shall make the determination required to carry out the provisions of this section not later than 90 days after the notification by the insurance beneficiary and shall make payment in full on the amount of the beneficiary\u2019s loss pending completion of the due diligence investigation.\n(b) Effect of payment of loss. Upon payment of the amount of the loss pursuant to subsection (a), the United States shall be subrogated for all of the rights of the holder of the obligation upon the insured loan and shall be entitled to an assignment of the note or other evidence of the insured loan by the insurance beneficiary. If the net recovery made by the Secretary on a loan after deduction of the cost of that recovery (including reasonable administrative costs and collection costs, to the extent set forth in regulations issued by the Secretary) exceeds the amount of the loss, the excess shall be paid over to the insured. The Secretary may, in attempting to make recovery on such loans, contract with private business concerns, State student loan insurance agencies, or State guaranty agencies, for payment for services rendered by such concerns or agencies in assisting the Secretary in making such recovery. Any contract under this subsection entered into by the Secretary shall provide that attempts to make recovery on such loans shall be fair and reasonable, and do not involve harassment, intimidation, false or misleading representations, or unnecessary communications concerning the existence of any such loan to persons other than the student borrower.\n(c) Forbearance not precluded. Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to preclude any forbearance for the benefit of the student borrower which may be agreed upon by the parties to the insured loan and approved by the Secretary, or to preclude forbearance by the Secretary in the enforcement of the insured obligation after payment on that insurance. Any forbearance which is approved by the Secretary under this subsection with respect to the repayment of a loan, including a forbearance during default, shall not be considered as indicating that a holder of a federally insured loan has failed to exercise reasonable care and due diligence in the collection of the loan.\n(d) Care and diligence required of holders. Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed to excuse the holder of a federally insured loan from exercising reasonable care and diligence in the making and collection of loans under the provisions of this part. If the Secretary, after a reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to an eligible lender, finds that it has substantially failed to exercise such care and diligence or to make the reports and statements required under section 1078(a)(4) of this title and section 1079(a)(3) of this title, or to pay the required Federal loan insurance premiums, the Secretary shall disqualify that lender for further Federal insurance on loans granted pursuant to this part until the Secretary is satisfied that its failure has ceased and finds that there is reasonable assurance that the lender will in the future exercise necessary care and diligence or comply with such requirements, as the case may be.\n(e) Default rate of lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies.\n  (1) In general. The Secretary shall annually publish a list indicating the cohort default rate (determined in accordance with section 1085(m) of this title) for each originating lender, subsequent holder, and guaranty agency participating in the program assisted under this part and an average cohort default rate for all institutions of higher education within each State.\n  (2) Regulations. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution of a cohort default rate through the use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control, or any similar device.\n  (3) Rate establishment and correction. The Secretary shall establish a cohort default rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies (determined consistent with section 1085(m) of this title), except that the rate for lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies shall not reflect any loans issued in accordance with section 1078(j) of this title. The Secretary shall allow institutions, lenders, holders, and guaranty agencies the opportunity to correct such cohort default rate information.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above where the term \"Secretary concerned\" is defined?

Findings and purposes.\n(a) The Congress makes the following findings:\n  (1) Governmentally administered mental health services in the District of Columbia are currently provided through two separate public entities, the federally administered Saint Elizabeths Hospital and the Mental Health Services Administration of the District of Columbia Department of Human Resources.\n  (2) The District of Columbia has a continuing responsibility to provide mental health services to its residents.\n  (3) The Federal Government, through its operation of a national mental health program at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, has for over 100 years assisted the District of Columbia in carrying out that responsibility.\n  (4) Since its establishment by Congress in 1855, Saint Elizabeths Hospital has developed into a respected national mental health hospital and study, training, and treatment center, providing a range of quality mental health and related services, including\u2014\n    (i) acute and chronic inpatient psychiatric care;\n    (ii) outpatient psychiatric and substance abuse clinical and related services;\n    (iii) Federal court system forensic psychiatry referral, evaluation, and patient treatment services for prisoners, and for individuals awaiting trial or requiring post-trial or post-sentence psychiatric evaluation;\n    (iv) patient care and related services for designated classes of individuals entitled to mental health benefits under Federal law, such as certain members and employees of the United States Armed Forces and the Foreign Service, and residents of American overseas dependencies;\n    (v) District of Columbia court system forensic psychiatry referral, evaluation, and patient treatment services for prisoners, and for individuals awaiting trial or requiring post-trial or postsentence psychiatric evaluation;\n    (vi) programs for special populations such as the mentally ill deaf;\n    (vii) support for basic and applied clinical psychiatric research and related patient services conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and other institutions; and\n    (viii) professional and paraprofessional training in the major mental health disciplines.\n  (5) The continuation of the range of services currently provided by federally administered Saint Elizabeths Hospital must be assured, as these services are integrally related to\u2014\n    (i) the availability of adequate mental health services to District of Columbia residents, nonresidents who require mental health services while in the District of Columbia, individuals entitled to mental health services under Federal law, and individuals referred by both Federal and local court systems; and\n    (ii) the Nation\u2019s capacity to increase our knowledge and understanding about mental illness and to facilitate and continue the development and broad availability of sound and modern methods and approaches for the treatment of mental illness.\n  (6) The assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and resources of Saint Elizabeths Hospital from the Federal Government by the District of Columbia, and the integration of those functions, resources, and programs into a comprehensive mental health care system administered solely by the District of Columbia, will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the services currently provided through those two separate entities by shifting the primary focus of care to an integrated community-based system.\n  (7) Such assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and resources of Saint Elizabeths Hospital by the District of Columbia would further the principle of home rule for the District of Columbia.\n(b) It is the intent of Congress that\u2014\n  (1) the District of Columbia have in operation no later than October 1, 1993, an integrated coordinated mental health system in the District which provides\u2014\n    (A) high quality, cost-effective, and community-based programs and facilities;\n    (B) a continuum of inpatient and outpatient mental health care, residential treatment, and support services through an appropriate balance of public and private resources; and\n    (C) assurances that patient rights and medical needs are protected;\n  (2) the comprehensive District mental health care system be in full compliance with the Federal court consent decree in Dixon v. Heckler;\n  (3) the District and Federal Governments bear equitable shares of the costs of a transition from the present system to a comprehensive District mental health system;\n  (4) the transition to a comprehensive District mental health system provided for by this subchapter be carried out with maximum consideration for the interests of employees of the Hospital and provide a right-of-first-refusal to such employees for employment at comparable levels in positions created under the system implementation plan;\n  (5) the Federal Government have the responsibility for the retraining of Hospital employees to prepare such employees for the requirements of employment in a comprehensive District mental health system;\n  (6) the Federal Government continue high quality mental health research, training, and demonstration programs at Saint Elizabeths Hospital;\n  (7) the District government establish and maintain accreditation and licensing standards for all services provided in District mental health facilities which assure quality care consistent with appropriate Federal regulations and comparable with standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals; and\n  (8) the comprehensive mental health system plan include a component for direct services for the homeless mentally ill.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above where the term \"tribal social services agency\" is defined?

Renewable Resource Assessment.\n(a) Preparation by Secretary of Agriculture; time of preparation, updating and contents. In recognition of the vital importance of America\u2019s renewable resources of the forest, range, and other associated lands to the Nation\u2019s social and economic well-being, and of the necessity for a long term perspective in planning and undertaking related national renewable resource programs administered by the Forest Service, the Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this subchapter as the \u201cSecretary\u201d) shall prepare a Renewable Resource Assessment (hereinafter called the \u201cAssessment\u201d). The Assessment shall be prepared not later than December 31, 1975, and shall be updated during 1979 and each tenth year thereafter, and shall include but not be limited to\u2014\n  (1) an analysis of present and anticipated uses, demand for, and supply of the renewable resources, with consideration of the international resource situation, and an emphasis of pertinent supply and demand and price relationship trends;\n  (2) an inventory, based on information developed by the Forest Service and other Federal agencies, of present and potential renewable resources, and an evaluation of opportunities for improving their yield of tangible and intangible goods and services, together with estimates of investment costs and direct and indirect returns to the Federal Government;\n  (3) a description of Forest Service programs and responsibilities in research, cooperative programs and management of the National Forest System, their interrelationships, and the relationship of these programs and responsibilities to public and private activities;\n  (4) a discussion of important policy considerations, laws, regulations, and other factors expected to influence and affect significantly the use, ownership, and management of forest, range, and other associated lands; and\n  (5) an analysis of the potential effects of global climate change on the condition of renewable resources on the forests and rangelands of the United States; and\n  (6) an analysis of the rural and urban forestry opportunities to mitigate the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide and reduce the risk of global climate change,\n(b) Omitted.\n(c) Contents of Assessments. The Secretary shall report in the 1979 and subsequent Assessments on:\n  (1) the additional fiber potential in the National Forest System including, but not restricted to, forest mortality, growth, salvage potential, potential increased forest products sales, economic constraints, alternate markets, contract considerations, and other multiple use considerations;\n  (2) the potential for increased utilization of forest and wood product wastes in the National Forest System and on other lands, and of urban wood wastes and wood product recycling, including recommendations to the Congress for actions which would lead to increased utilization of material now being wasted both in the forests and in manufactured products; and\n  (3) the milling and other wood fiber product fabrication facilities and their location in the United States, noting the public and private forested areas that supply such facilities, assessing the degree of utilization into product form of harvested trees by such facilities, and setting forth the technology appropriate to the facilities to improve utilization either individually or in aggregate units of harvested trees and to reduce wasted wood fibers. The Secretary shall set forth a program to encourage the adoption by these facilities of these technologies for improving wood fiber utilization.\n(d) Public involvement; consultation with governmental departments and agencies. In developing the reports required under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall provide opportunity for public involvement and shall consult with other interested governmental departments and agencies.\n(e) Congressional policy of multiple use sustained yield management; examination and certification of lands; estimate of appropriations necessary for reforestation and other treatment; budget requirements; authorization of appropriations.\n  (1) It is the policy of the Congress that all forested lands in the National Forest System shall be maintained in appropriate forest cover with species of trees, degree of stocking, rate of growth, and conditions of stand designed to secure the maximum benefits of multiple use sustained yield management in accordance with land management plans. Accordingly, the Secretary is directed to identify and report to the Congress annually at the time of submission of the President\u2019s budget together with the annual report provided for under section 1606(c) of this title, beginning with submission of the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1978, the amount and location by forests and States and by productivity class, where practicable, of all lands in the National Forest System where objectives of land management plans indicate the need to reforest areas that have been cut-over or otherwise denuded or deforested, and all lands with stands of trees that are not growing at their best potential rate of growth. All national forest lands treated from year to year shall be examined after the first and third growing seasons and certified by the Secretary in the report provided for under this subsection as to stocking rate, growth rate in relation to potential and other pertinent measures. Any lands not certified as satisfactory shall be returned to the backlog and scheduled for prompt treatment. The level and types of treatment shall be those which secure the most effective mix of multiple use benefits.\n  (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1607 of this title, the Secretary shall, annually during each of the 10 years beginning after November 15, 2021, transmit to the Congress in the manner provided in this subsection an estimate of the sums necessary to be appropriated, in addition to the funds available from other sources, to replant and otherwise treat an acreage equal to the acreage to be cut over that year, plus a sufficient portion of the backlog of lands found to be in need of treatment to eliminate the backlog within the 10-year period. After the 10-year period, the Secretary shall transmit annually to the Congress an estimate of the sums necessary to replant and otherwise treat all lands being cut over and maintain planned timber production on all other forested lands in the National Forest System so as to prevent the development of a backlog of needed work larger than the needed work at the beginning of the fiscal year.

For purposes of this section, a taxpayer uses a dwelling unit during the taxable year as a residence if he uses such unit (or portion thereof) for personal purposes for a number of days which exceeds the greater of\u2014\n    (A) 14 days, or\n    (B) 10 percent of the number of days during such year for which such unit is rented at a fair rental.\n  For purposes of subparagraph (B), a unit shall not be treated as rented at a fair rental for any day for which it is used for personal purposes.\n  (2) Personal use of unit. For purposes of this section, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have used a dwelling unit for personal purposes for a day if, for any part of such day, the unit is used\u2014\n    (A) for personal purposes by the taxpayer or any other person who has an interest in such unit, or by any member of the family (as defined in section 267(c)(4)) of the taxpayer or such other person;\n    (B) by any individual who uses the unit under an arrangement which enables the taxpayer to use some other dwelling unit (whether or not a rental is charged for the use of such other unit); or\n    (C) by any individual (other than an employee with respect to whose use section 119 applies), unless for such day the dwelling unit is rented for a rental which, under the facts and circumstances, is fair rental.\n  The Secretary shall prescribe regulations with respect to the circumstances under which use of the unit for repairs and annual maintenance will not constitute personal use under this paragraph, except that if the taxpayer is engaged in repair and maintenance on a substantially full time basis for any day, such authority shall not allow the Secretary to treat a dwelling unit as being used for personal use by the taxpayer on such day merely because other individuals who are on the premises on such day are not so engaged.\n  (3) Rental to family member, etc., for use as principal residence.\n    (A) In general. A taxpayer shall not be treated as using a dwelling unit for personal purposes by reason of a rental arrangement for any period if for such period such dwelling unit is rented, at a fair rental, to any person for use as such person\u2019s principal residence.\n    (B) Special rules for rental to person having interest in unit.\n      (i) Rental must be pursuant to shared equity financing agreement.

In the case of a rental pursuant to a shared equity financing agreement, fair rental shall be determined as of the time the agreement is entered into and by taking into account the occupant\u2019s qualified ownership interest.\n    (C) Shared equity financing agreement. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \u201cshared equity financing agreement\u201d means an agreement under which\u2014\n      (i) 2 or more persons acquire qualified ownership interests in a dwelling unit, and\n      (ii) the person (or persons) holding 1 or more of such interests\u2014\n        (I) is entitled to occupy the dwelling unit for use as a principal residence, and\n        (II) is required to pay rent to 1 or more other persons holding qualified ownership interests in the dwelling unit.\n    (D) Qualified ownership interest. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \u201cqualified ownership interest\u201d means an undivided interest for more than 50 years in the entire dwelling unit and appurtenant land being acquired in the transaction to which the shared equity financing agreement relates.\n  (4) Rental of principal residence.\n    (A) In general. For purposes of applying subsection (c)(5) to deductions allocable to a qualified rental period, a taxpayer shall not be considered to have used a dwelling unit for personal purposes for any day during the taxable year which occurs before or after a qualified rental period described in subparagraph (B)(i), or before a qualified rental period described in subparagraph (B)(ii), if with respect to such day such unit constitutes the principal residence (within the meaning of section 121) of the taxpayer.\n    (B) Qualified rental period. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term \u201cqualified rental period\u201d means a consecutive period of\u2014\n      (i) 12 or more months which begins or ends in such taxable year, or\n      (ii) less than 12 months which begins in such taxable year and at the end of which such dwelling unit is sold or exchanged, and\n    for which such unit is rented, or is held for rental, at a fair rental.\n(e) Expenses attributable to rental.\n  (1) In general. In any case where a taxpayer who is an individual or an S corporation uses a dwelling unit for personal purposes on any day during the taxable year (whether or not he is treated under this section as using such unit as a residence), the amount deductible under this chapter with respect to expenses attributable to the rental of the unit (or portion thereof) for the taxable year shall not exceed an amount which bears the same relationship to such expenses as the number of days during each year that the unit (or portion thereof) is rented at a fair rental bears to the total number of days during such year that the unit (or portion thereof) is used.\n  (2) Exception for deductions otherwise allowable. This subsection shall not apply with respect to deductions which would be allowable under this chapter for the taxable year whether or not such unit (or portion thereof) was rented.\n(f) Definitions and special rules.\n  (1) Dwelling unit defined. For purposes of this section\u2014\n    (A) In general.

In the case of an S corporation, subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (d)(2) shall be applied by substituting \u201cany shareholder of the S corporation\u201d for \u201cthe taxpayer\u201d each place it appears.\n  (3) Coordination with section 183. If subsection (a) applies with respect to any dwelling unit (or portion thereof) for the taxable year\u2014\n    (A) section 183 (relating to activities not engaged in for profit) shall not apply to such unit (or portion thereof) for such year, but\n    (B) such year shall be taken into account as a taxable year for purposes of applying subsection (d) of section 183 (relating to 5-year presumption).\n  (4) Coordination with section 162(a)(2). Nothing in this section shall be construed to disallow any deduction allowable under section 162(a)(2) (or any deduction which meets the tests of section 162(a)(2) but is allowable under another provision of this title) by reason of the taxpayer\u2019s being away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business (other than the trade or business of renting dwelling units).\n(g) Special rule for certain rental use. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or section 183, if a dwelling unit is used during the taxable year by the taxpayer as a residence and such dwelling unit is actually rented for less than 15 days during the taxable year, then\u2014\n  (1) no deduction otherwise allowable under this chapter because of the rental use of such dwelling unit shall be allowed, and\n  (2) the income derived from such use for the taxable year shall not be included in the gross income of such taxpayer under section 61.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above where the term \"shared equity financing agreement\" is defined?

Alternative fuel use by light duty Federal vehicles.\n(a) Department of Energy program.\n  (1) Beginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1990, the Secretary shall ensure, with the cooperation of other appropriate agencies and consistent with other Federal law, that the maximum number practicable of the vehicles acquired annually for use by the Federal Government shall be alternative fueled vehicles. In no event shall the number of such vehicles acquired be less than the number required under section 13212 of this title.\n  (2) In any determination of whether the acquisition of a vehicle is practicable under paragraph (1), the initial cost of such vehicle to the United States shall not be considered as a factor unless the initial cost of such vehicle exceeds the initial cost of a comparable gasoline or diesel fueled vehicle by at least 5 percent.\n  (3)\n    (A) To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall acquire both dedicated and dual fueled vehicles, and shall ensure that each type of alternative fueled vehicle is used by the Federal Government.\n    (B) Vehicles acquired under this section shall be acquired from original equipment manufacturers. If such vehicles are not available from original equipment manufacturers, vehicles converted to use alternative fuels may be acquired if, after conversion, the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s warranty continues to apply to such vehicles, pursuant to an agreement between the original equipment manufacturer and the person performing the conversion. This subparagraph shall not apply to vehicles acquired by the United States Postal Service pursuant to a contract entered into by the United States Postal Service before October 24, 1992, and which terminates on or before December 31, 1997.\n    (C) Alternative fueled vehicles, other than those described in subparagraph (B), may be acquired solely for the purposes of studies under subsection (b), whether or not original equipment manufacturer warranties still apply.\n    (D) In deciding which types of alternative fueled vehicles to acquire in implementing this part, the Secretary shall consider as a factor\u2014\n      (i) which types of vehicles yield the greatest reduction in pollutants emitted per dollar spent; and\n      (ii) the source of the fuel to supply the vehicles, giving preference to vehicles that operate on alternative fuels derived from domestic sources.\n    (E)\n      (i) Dual fueled vehicles acquired pursuant to this section shall be operated on alternative fuels unless the Secretary determines that an agency qualifies for a waiver of such requirement for vehicles operated by the agency in a particular geographic area in which\u2014\n        (I) the alternative fuel otherwise required to be used in the vehicle is not reasonably available to retail purchasers of the fuel, as certified to the Secretary by the head of the agency; or\n        (II) the cost of the alternative fuel otherwise required to be used in the vehicle is unreasonably more expensive compared to gasoline, as certified to the Secretary by the head of the agency.\n      (ii) The Secretary shall monitor compliance with this subparagraph by all such fleets and shall report annually to Congress on the extent to which the requirements of this subparagraph are being achieved. The report shall include information on annual reductions achieved from the use of petroleum-based fuels and the problems, if any, encountered in acquiring alternative fuels.\n    (F) At least 50 percent of the alternative fuels used in vehicles acquired pursuant to this section shall be derived from domestic feedstocks, except to the extent inconsistent with the multilateral trade agreements (as defined in section 3501(4) of title 19). The Secretary shall issue regulations to implement this requirement. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term \u201cdomestic\u201d has the meaning given such term in section 13211(7) of this title.\n    (G) Except to the extent inconsistent with the multilateral trade agreements (as defined in section 3501(4) of title 19), vehicles acquired under this section shall be motor vehicles manufactured in the United States or Canada.\n  (4) Acquisitions of vehicles under this section shall, to the extent practicable, be coordinated with acquisitions of alternative fueled vehicles by State and local governments.\n(b) Studies.\n  (1)\n    (A) The Secretary, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, shall conduct a study of a representative sample of alternative fueled vehicles in Federal fleets, which shall at a minimum address\u2014\n      (i) the performance of such vehicles, including performance in cold weather and at high altitude;\n      (ii) the fuel economy, safety, and emissions of such vehicles; and\n      (iii) a comparison of the operation and maintenance costs of such vehicles to the operation and maintenance costs of other passenger automobiles and light duty trucks.\n    (B) The Secretary shall provide a report on the results of the study conducted under subparagraph (A) to the Committees on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, within one year after the first such vehicles are acquired.\n  (2)\n    (A) The Secretary and the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall conduct a study of the advisability, feasibility, and timing of the disposal of vehicles acquired under subsection (a) and any problems of such disposal. Such study shall take into account existing laws governing the sale of Government vehicles and shall specifically focus on when to sell such vehicles and what price to charge, without compromising studies of the use of such vehicles authorized under this part.\n    (B) The Secretary and the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall report the results of the study conducted under subparagraph (A) to the Committees on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, within 12 months after funds are appropriated for carrying out this section.\n  (3) Studies undertaken under this subsection shall be coordinated with relevant testing activities of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation.\n(c) Availability to public. To the extent practicable, at locations where vehicles acquired under subsection (a) are supplied with alternative fuels, such fuels shall be offered for sale to the public. The head of the Federal agency responsible for such a location shall consider whether such sale is practicable, taking into account, among other factors\u2014\n  (1) whether alternative fuel is commercially available for vehicles in the vicinity of such location;\n  (2) security and safety considerations;\n  (3) whether such sale is in accordance with applicable local, State, and Federal law;\n  (4) the ease with which the public can access such location; and\n  (5) the cost to the United States of such sale.\n(d) Federal agency use of demonstration vehicles.\n  (1) Upon the request of the head of any agency of the Federal Government, the Secretary shall ensure that such Federal agency be provided with vehicles acquired under subsection (a) to the maximum extent practicable.\n  (2)\n    (A) Funds appropriated under this section for the acquisition of vehicles under subsection (a) shall be applicable only to the portion of the cost of vehicles acquired under subsection (a) which exceeds the cost of comparable gasoline or diesel fueled vehicles.\n    (B) To the extent that appropriations are available for such purposes, the Secretary shall ensure that the cost to any Federal agency receiving a vehicle under paragraph (1) shall not exceed the cost to such agency of a comparable gasoline or diesel fueled vehicle.\n  (3) Only one-half of the vehicles acquired under this section by an agency of the Federal Government shall be counted against any limitation under law, Executive order, or executive or agency policy on the number of vehicles which may be acquired by such agency.\n  (4) Any Federal agency receiving a vehicle under paragraph (1) shall cooperate with studies undertaken by the Secretary under subsection (b).\n(e) Detail of personnel. Upon the request of the Secretary, the head of any Federal agency may detail, on a reimbursable basis, any of the personnel of such agency to the Department of Energy to assist the Secretary in carrying out the Secretary\u2019s duties under this section.\n(f) Exemptions.\n  (1) Vehicles acquired under this section shall not be counted in any calculation of the average fuel economy of the fleet of passenger automobiles acquired in a fiscal year by the United States.\n  (2) The incremental cost of vehicles acquired under this section over the cost of comparable gasoline or diesel fueled vehicles shall not be applied to any calculation with respect to a limitation under law on the maximum cost of individual vehicles which may be acquired by the United States.\n(g) Definitions. For purposes of this part\u2014\n  (1) the term \u201cacquired\u201d means leased for a period of sixty continuous days or more, or purchased;\n  (2) the term \u201calternative fuel\u201d means methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols; mixtures containing 85 percent or more (or such other percentage, but not less than 70 percent, as determined by the Secretary, by rule, to provide for requirements relating to cold start, safety, or vehicle functions) by volume of methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols with gasoline or other fuels; natural gas; liquefied petroleum gas; hydrogen; coal-derived liquid fuels; fuels (other than alcohol) derived from biological materials; electricity (including electricity from solar energy); and any other fuel the Secretary determines, by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits;\n  (3) the term \u201calternative fueled vehicle\u201d means a dedicated vehicle or a dual fueled vehicle;\n  (4) the term \u201cdedicated vehicle\u201d means\u2014\n    (A) a dedicated automobile, as such term is defined in section 32901(a)(7) of title 49; or\n    (B) a motor vehicle, other than an automobile, that operates solely on alternative fuel;\n  (5) the term \u201cdual fueled vehicle\u201d means\u2014\n    (A) dual fueled automobile, as such term is defined in section 32901(a)(8) 1 of title 49; or\n    (B) a motor vehicle, other than an automobile, that is capable of operating on alternative fuel and is capable of operating on gasoline or diesel fuel; and\n  (6) the term \u201cheavy duty vehicle\u201d means a vehicle of greater than 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating.\n(h) Funding.\n  (1) For the purposes of this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1993 through 1998, to remain available until expended.\n  (2) The authority of the Secretary to obligate amounts to be expended under this section shall be effective for any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance by appropriation Acts.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above where the term \"alternative fuel\" is defined?

{"id": "test4k_usc_def2c_76", "task": "defined2cite", "texttype": "uscode", "prompt": "\u00a7 2152f. Assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children.\n(a) Findings. Congress finds the following:\n  (1) There are more than 143,000,000 orphans living sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Of this number, approximately 16,200,000 children have lost both parents.\n  (2) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has created an unprecedented orphan crisis, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where children have been hardest hit. The pandemic is deepening poverty in entire communities, and is jeopardizing the health, safety, and survival of all children in affected countries. It is estimated that 14,000,000 children have lost one or both parents to AIDS.\n  (3) The orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for human welfare, development, and political stability that extend far beyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide.\n  (4) Extended families and local communities are struggling to meet the basic needs of orphans and vulnerable children by providing food, health care including treatment of children living with HIV/AIDS, education expenses, and clothing.\n  (5) Famines, natural disasters, chronic poverty, ongoing conflicts, and civil wars in developing countries are adversely affecting children in these countries, the vast majority of whom currently do not receive humanitarian assistance or other support from the United States.\n  (6) The United States Government administers various assistance programs for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. In order to improve targeting and programming of resources, the United States Agency for International Development should develop methods to adequately track the overall number of orphans and other vulnerable children receiving assistance, the kinds of programs for such children by sector and location, and any other such related data and analysis.\n  (7) The United States Agency for International Development should improve its capabilities to deliver assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries through partnerships with private volunteer organizations, including community and faith-based organizations.\n  (8) The United States Agency for International Development should be the primary United States Government agency responsible for identifying and assisting orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.\n  (9) Providing assistance to such children is an important expression of the humanitarian concern and tradition of the people of the United States.\n(b) Definitions. In this section:\n  (1) AIDS. The term \u201cAIDS\u201d has the meaning given the term in section 2151b\u20132(g)(1) of this title.\n  (2) Children. The term \u201cchildren\u201d means persons who have not attained 18 years of age.\n  (3) HIV/AIDS. The term \u201cHIV/AIDS\u201d has the meaning given the term in section 2151b\u20132(g)(3) 2 of this title.\n  (4) Orphan. The term \u201corphan\u201d means a child deprived by death of one or both parents.\n  (5) Psychosocial support. The term \u201cpsychosocial support\u201d includes care that addresses the ongoing psychological and social problems that affect individuals, their partners, families, and caregivers in order to alleviate suffering, strengthen social ties and integration, provide emotional support, and promote coping strategies.\n(c) Assistance. The President is authorized to provide assistance, including providing such assistance through international or nongovernmental organizations, for programs in developing countries to provide basic care and services for orphans and other vulnerable children. Such programs should provide assistance\u2014\n  (1) to support families and communities to mobilize their own resources through the establishment of community-based organizations to provide basic care for orphans and other vulnerable children;\n  (2) for school food programs, including the purchase of local or regional foodstuffs where appropriate;\n  (3) to increase primary school enrollment through the elimination of school fees, where appropriate, or other barriers to education while ensuring that adequate resources exist for teacher training and infrastructure;\n  (4) to provide employment training and related services for orphans and other vulnerable children who are of legal working age;\n  (5) to protect and promote the inheritance rights of orphans, other vulnerable children, and widows;\n  (6) to provide culturally appropriate psychosocial support to orphans and other vulnerable children; and\n  (7) to treat orphans and other vulnerable children with HIV/AIDS through the provision of pharmaceuticals, the recruitment and training of individuals to provide pediatric treatment, and the purchase of pediatric-specific technologies.\n(d) Monitoring and evaluation.\n  (1) Establishment. To maximize the sustainable development impact of assistance authorized under this section, and pursuant to the strategy required in section 4 of the Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of 2005, the President shall establish a monitoring and evaluation system to measure the effectiveness of United States assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children.\n  (2) Requirements. The monitoring and evaluation system shall\u2014\n    (A) establish performance goals for the assistance and expresses such goals in an objective and quantifiable form, to the extent feasible;\n    (B) establish performance indicators to be used in measuring or assessing the achievement of the performance goals described in subparagraph (A); and\n    (C) provide a basis for recommendations for adjustments to the assistance to enhance the impact of assistance.\n(e) Special Advisor for Assistance to Orphans and Vulnerable Children.\n  (1) Appointment.\n    (A) In general.

Subject to the authority of the Secretary, the Chief Operating Officer of a PBO may exercise the authority of the Secretary to procure property and services in the performance of functions managed by the PBO. For the purposes of this section, the term \u201cPBO\u201d includes the Chief Operating Officer of the PBO and any employee of the PBO exercising procurement authority under the preceding sentence.\n(b) In general. Except as provided in this section, the PBO shall abide by all applicable Federal procurement laws and regulations when procuring property and services. The PBO shall\u2014\n  (1) enter into contracts to carry out the functions set forth in section 1018(b)(2) of this title;\n  (2) obtain the services of experts and consultants without regard to section 3109 of title 5 and set pay in accordance with such section; and\n  (3) through the Chief Operating Officer\u2014\n    (A) to the maximum extent practicable, utilize procurement systems that streamline operations, improve internal controls, and enhance management; and\n    (B) assess the efficiency of such systems and assess such systems\u2019 ability to meet PBO requirements.\n(c) Service contracts.\n  (1) Performance-based servicing contracts. The Chief Operating Officer shall, to the extent practicable, maximize the use of performance-based servicing contracts, consistent with guidelines for such contracts published by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, to achieve cost savings and improve service.\n  (2) Fee for service arrangements. The Chief Operating Officer shall, when appropriate and consistent with the purposes of the PBO, acquire services related to the functions set forth in section 1018(b)(2) of this title from any entity that has the capability and capacity to meet the requirements set by the PBO. The Chief Operating Officer is authorized to pay fees that are equivalent to those paid by other entities to an organization that provides services that meet the requirements of the PBO, as determined by the Chief Operating Officer.\n(d) Two-phase source-selection procedures.\n  (1) In general. The PBO may use a two-phase process for selecting a source for a procurement of property or services.\n  (2) First phase. The procedures for the first phase of the process for a procurement are as follows:\n    (A) Publication of notice. The contracting officer for the procurement shall publish a notice of the procurement in accordance with section 1708 of title 41 and subsections (e), (f), and (g) of section 637 of title 15, except that the notice shall include only the following:\n      (i) A general description of the scope or purpose of the procurement that provides sufficient information on the scope or purpose for sources to make informed business decisions regarding whether to participate in the procurement.\n      (ii) A description of the basis on which potential sources are to be selected to submit offers in the second phase.\n      (iii) A description of the information that is to be required under subparagraph (B).\n      (iv) Any additional information that the contracting officer determines appropriate.\n    (B) Information submitted by offerors. Each offeror for the procurement shall submit basic information, such as information on the offeror\u2019s qualifications, the proposed conceptual approach, costs likely to be associated with the proposed conceptual approach, and past performance of the offeror, together with any additional information that is requested by the contracting officer.\n    (C) Selection for second phase. The contracting officer shall select the offerors that are to be eligible to participate in the second phase of the process. The contracting officer shall limit the number of the selected offerors to the number of sources that the contracting officer determines is appropriate and in the best interests of the Federal Government.\n  (3) Second phase.\n    (A) In general. The contracting officer shall conduct the second phase of the source selection process in accordance with sections 3306(a) to (e) and 3308, chapter 37, and section 4702 of title 41.\n    (B) Eligible participants. Only the sources selected in the first phase of the process shall be eligible to participate in the second phase.\n    (C) Single or multiple procurements. The second phase may include a single procurement or multiple procurements within the scope, or for the purpose, described in the notice pursuant to paragraph (2)(A).\n  (4) Procedures considered competitive. The procedures used for selecting a source for a procurement under this subsection shall be considered competitive procedures for all purposes.\n(e) Use of simplified procedures for commercial products and commercial services. Whenever the PBO anticipates that commercial products or commercial services will be offered for a procurement, the PBO may use (consistent with the special rules for commercial products and commercial services) the special simplified procedures for the procurement without regard to any dollar limitation otherwise applicable to the use of those procedures.\n(f) Flexible wait periods and deadlines for submission of offers of noncommercial products and services.\n  (1) Authority. In carrying out a procurement, the PBO may\u2014\n    (A) apply a shorter waiting period for the issuance of a solicitation after the publication of a notice under section 1708 of title 41 than is required under subsection (a)(3)(A) of such section; and\n    (B) notwithstanding subsection (a)(3) of such section, establish any deadline for the submission of bids or proposals that affords potential offerors a reasonable opportunity to respond to the solicitation.\n  (2) Inapplicability to commercial products and services. Paragraph (1) does not apply to a procurement of a commercial product or a commercial service.\n  (3) Consistency with applicable international agreements. If an international agreement is applicable to the procurement, any exercise of authority under paragraph (1) shall be consistent with the international agreement.\n(g) Modular contracting.\n  (1) In general. The PBO may satisfy the requirements of the PBO for a system incrementally by carrying out successive procurements of modules of the system. In doing so, the PBO may use procedures authorized under this subsection to procure any such module after the first module.\n  (2) Utility requirement. A module may not be procured for a system under this subsection unless the module is useful independently of the other modules or useful in combination with another module previously procured for the system.\n  (3) Conditions for use of authority. The PBO may use procedures authorized under paragraph (4) for the procurement of an additional module for a system if\u2014\n    (A) competitive procedures were used for awarding the contract for the procurement of the first module for the system; and\n    (B) the solicitation for the first module included\u2014\n      (i) a general description of the entire system that was sufficient to provide potential offerors with reasonable notice of the general scope of future modules;\n      (ii) other information sufficient for potential offerors to make informed business judgments regarding whether to submit offers for the contract for the first module; and\n      (iii) a statement that procedures authorized under this subsection could be used for awarding subsequent contracts for the procurement of additional modules for the system.\n  (4) Procedures. If the procurement of the first module for a system meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (3), the PBO may award a contract for the procurement of an additional module for the system using any of the following procedures:\n    (A) Single-source basis. Award of the contract on a single-source basis to a contractor who was awarded a contract for a module previously procured for the system under competitive procedures or procedures authorized under subparagraph (B).\n    (B) Adequate competition. Award of the contract on the basis of offers made by\u2014\n      (i) a contractor who was awarded a contract for a module previously procured for the system after having been selected for award of the contract under this subparagraph or other competitive procedures; and\n      (ii) at least one other offeror that submitted an offer for a module previously procured for the system and is expected, on the basis of the offer for the previously procured module, to submit a competitive offer for the additional module.\n    (C) Other. Award of the contract under any other procedure authorized by law.\n  (5) Notice requirement.\n    (A) Publication. Not less than 30 days before issuing a solicitation for offers for a contract for a module for a system under procedures authorized under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (4), the PBO shall publish in the Commerce Business Daily a notice of the intent to use such procedures to enter into the contract.\n    (B) Exception. Publication of a notice is not required under this paragraph with respect to a use of procedures authorized under paragraph (4) if the contractor referred to in that subparagraph (who is to be solicited to submit an offer) has previously provided a module for the system under a contract that contained cost, schedule, and performance goals and the contractor met those goals.\n    (C) Content of notice. A notice published under subparagraph (A) with respect to a use of procedures described in paragraph (4) shall contain the information required under section 1708(c) of title 41, other than paragraph (4) of such section, and shall invite the submission of any assertion that the use of the procedures for the procurement involved is not in the best interest of the Federal Government together with information supporting the assertion.\n  (6) Documentation. The basis for an award of a contract under this subsection shall be documented. However, a justification pursuant to section 3304(e) of title 41 or section 637(h) of title 15 is not required.\n  (7) Simplified source-selection procedures. The PBO may award a contract under any other simplified procedures prescribed by the PBO for the selection of sources for the procurement of modules for a system, after the first module, that are not to be procured under a contract awarded on a single-source basis.\n(h) Use of simplified procedures for small business set-asides for services other than commercial services.\n  (1) Authority. The PBO may use special simplified procedures for a procurement of services that are not commercial services if\u2014\n    (A) the procurement is in an amount not greater than $1,000,000;\n    (B) the procurement is conducted as a small business set-aside pursuant to section 644(a) of title 15; and\n    (C) the price charged for supplies associated with the services procured are items of supply expected to be less than 20 percent of the total contract price.\n  (2) Inapplicability to certain procurements. The authority set forth in paragraph (1) may not be used for\u2014\n    (A) an award of a contract on a single-source basis; or\n    (B) a contract for construction.\n(i) Guidance for use of authority.\n  (1) Issuance by PBO. The Chief Operating Officer of the PBO, in consultation with the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, shall issue guidance for the use by PBO personnel of the authority provided in this section.\n  (2) Guidance from OFPP. As part of the consultation required under paragraph (1), the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall provide the PBO with guidance that is designed to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the authority under this section is exercised by the PBO in a manner that is consistent with the exercise of the authority by the heads of the other performance-based organizations.\n  (3) Compliance with OFPP guidance. The head of the PBO shall ensure that the procurements of the PBO under this section are carried out in a manner that is consistent with the guidance provided for the PBO under paragraph (2).\n(j) Limitation on multiagency contracting. No department or agency of the Federal Government may purchase property or services under contracts entered into or administered by a PBO under this section unless the purchase is approved in advance by the senior procurement official of that department or agency who is responsible for purchasing by the department or agency.\n(k) Laws not affected. Nothing in this section shall be construed to waive laws for the enforcement of civil rights or for the establishment and enforcement of labor standards that are applicable to contracts of the Federal Government.\n(l) Definitions. In this section:\n  (1) Commercial product. The term \u201ccommercial product\u201d has the meaning given the term in section 103 of title 41.\n  (2) Commercial service. The term \u201ccommercial service\u201d has the meaning given the term in section 103a of title 41.\n  (3) Competitive procedures.

and\n      (ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.\n    (F) Any State or local official including a legislator or unit of government whose jurisdiction or function includes the appropriation of funds for the construction, operation, or maintenance of prison facilities, or the prosecution or custody of persons who may be released from, or not admitted to, a prison as a result of a prisoner release order shall have standing to oppose the imposition or continuation in effect of such relief and to seek termination of such relief, and shall have the right to intervene in any proceeding relating to such relief.\n(b) Termination of Relief.\u2014\n  (1) Termination of prospective relief.\u2014\n    (A) In any civil action with respect to prison conditions in which prospective relief is ordered, such relief shall be terminable upon the motion of any party or intervener\u2014\n      (i) 2 years after the date the court granted or approved the prospective relief;\n      (ii) 1 year after the date the court has entered an order denying termination of prospective relief under this paragraph;

No postponement shall be permissible because of general congestion of the court\u2019s calendar.\n  (4) Order blocking the automatic stay.\u2014 Any order staying, suspending, delaying, or barring the operation of the automatic stay described in paragraph (2) (other than an order to postpone the effective date of the automatic stay under paragraph (3)) shall be treated as an order refusing to dissolve or modify an injunction and shall be appealable pursuant to section 1292(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, regardless of how the order is styled or whether the order is termed a preliminary or a final ruling.\n(f) Special Masters.\u2014\n  (1) In general.\u2014\n    (A) In any civil action in a Federal court with respect to prison conditions, the court may appoint a special master who shall be disinterested and objective and who will give due regard to the public safety, to conduct hearings on the record and prepare proposed findings of fact.\n    (B) The court shall appoint a special master under this subsection during the remedial phase of the action only upon a finding that the remedial phase will be sufficiently complex to warrant the appointment.\n  (2) Appointment.\u2014\n    (A) If the court determines that the appointment of a special master is necessary, the court shall request that the defendant institution and the plaintiff each submit a list of not more than 5 persons to serve as a special master.\n    (B) Each party shall have the opportunity to remove up to 3 persons from the opposing party\u2019s list.\n    (C) The court shall select the master from the persons remaining on the list after the operation of subparagraph (B).\n  (3) Interlocutory appeal.\u2014 Any party shall have the right to an interlocutory appeal of the judge\u2019s selection of the special master under this subsection, on the ground of partiality.\n  (4) Compensation.\u2014 The compensation to be allowed to a special master under this section shall be based on an hourly rate not greater than the hourly rate established under section 3006A for payment of court-appointed counsel, plus costs reasonably incurred by the special master. Such compensation and costs shall be paid with funds appropriated to the Judiciary.\n  (5) Regular review of appointment.\u2014 In any civil action with respect to prison conditions in which a special master is appointed under this subsection, the court shall review the appointment of the special master every 6 months to determine whether the services of the special master continue to be required under paragraph (1). In no event shall the appointment of a special master extend beyond the termination of the relief.\n  (6) Limitations on powers and duties.\u2014 A special master appointed under this subsection\u2014\n    (A) may be authorized by a court to conduct hearings and prepare proposed findings of fact, which shall be made on the record;\n    (B) shall not make any findings or communications ex parte;\n    (C) may be authorized by a court to assist in the development of remedial plans; and\n    (D) may be removed at any time, but shall be relieved of the appointment upon the termination of relief.\n(g) Definitions.\u2014 As used in this section\u2014\n  (1) the term \u201cconsent decree\u201d means any relief entered by the court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties but does not include private settlements;\n  (2) the term \u201ccivil action with respect to prison conditions\u201d means any civil proceeding arising under Federal law with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of persons confined in prison, but does not include habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact or duration of confinement in prison;\n  (3) the term \u201cprisoner\u201d means any person subject to incarceration, detention, or admission to any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program;\n  (4) the term \u201cprisoner release order\u201d includes any order, including a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief, that has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population, or that directs the release from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison;\n  (5) the term \u201cprison\u201d means any Federal, State, or local facility that incarcerates or detains juveniles or adults accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law;\n  (6) the term \u201cprivate settlement agreement\u201d means an agreement entered into among the parties that is not subject to judicial enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the agreement settled;\n  (7) the term \u201cprospective relief\u201d means all relief other than compensatory monetary damages;\n  (8) the term \u201cspecial master\u201d means any person appointed by a Federal court pursuant to Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or pursuant to any inherent power of the court to exercise the powers of a master, regardless of the title or description given by the court; and\n  (9) the term \u201crelief\u201d means all relief in any form that may be granted or approved by the court, and includes consent decrees but does not include private settlement agreements.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above where the term \"private settlement agreement\" is defined?

If the Secretary determines that any such factor may not reasonably be used to predict the use of the health services by individuals and families, the Secretary shall disapprove such factor for such purpose. If a health maintenance organization is to fix rates of payment for a group under clause (ii), it shall, upon request of the entity with which it contracts to provide services to such group, disclose to that entity the method and data used in calculating the rates of payment.\n  (D) The following differentials in rates of payments may be established under the systems described in subparagraphs (B) and (C):\n    (i) Nominal differentials in such rates may be established to reflect differences in marketing costs and the different administrative costs of collecting payments from the following categories of members:\n      (I) Individual members (including their families).\n      (II) Small groups of members (as determined under regulations of the Secretary).\n      (III) Large groups of members (as determined under regulations of the Secretary).\n    (ii) Nominal differentials in such rates may be established to reflect the compositing of the rates of payment in a systematic manner to accommodate group purchasing practices of the various employers.\n    (iii) Differentials in such rates may be established for members enrolled in a health maintenance organization pursuant to a contract with a governmental authority under section 1079 or 1086 of title 10 or under any other governmental program (other than the health benefits program authorized by chapter 89 of title 5) or any health benefits program for employees of States, political subdivision of States, and other public entities.\n(9) The term \u201cnon-metropolitan area\u201d means an area no part of which is within an area designated as a standard metropolitan statistical area by the Office of Management and Budget and which does not contain a city whose population exceeds fifty thousand individuals.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above where the term \"community rating system\" is defined?

Appropriate remedies with respect to prison conditions.\n(a) Requirements for Relief.\u2014\n  (1) Prospective relief.\u2014\n    (A) Prospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.\n    (B) The court shall not order any prospective relief that requires or permits a government official to exceed his or her authority under State or local law or otherwise violates State or local law, unless\u2014\n      (i) Federal law requires such relief to be ordered in violation of State or local law;\n      (ii) the relief is necessary to correct the violation of a Federal right; and\n      (iii) no other relief will correct the violation of the Federal right.\n    (C) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the courts, in exercising their remedial powers, to order the construction of prisons or the raising of taxes, or to repeal or detract from otherwise applicable limitations on the remedial powers of the courts.\n  (2) Preliminary injunctive relief.\u2014 In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, to the extent otherwise authorized by law, the court may enter a temporary restraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive relief. Preliminary injunctive relief must be narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the preliminary relief and shall respect the principles of comity set out in paragraph (1)(B) in tailoring any preliminary relief. Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on the date that is 90 days after its entry, unless the court makes the findings required under subsection (a)(1) for the entry of prospective relief and makes the order final before the expiration of the 90-day period.\n  (3) Prisoner release order.\u2014\n    (A) In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, no court shall enter a prisoner release order unless\u2014\n      (i) a court has previously entered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner release order; and\n      (ii) the defendant has had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous court orders.\n    (B) In any civil action in Federal court with respect to prison conditions, a prisoner release order shall be entered only by a three-judge court in accordance with section 2284 of title 28, if the requirements of subparagraph (E) have been met.\n    (C) A party seeking a prisoner release order in Federal court shall file with any request for such relief, a request for a three-judge court and materials sufficient to demonstrate that the requirements of subparagraph (A) have been met.\n    (D) If the requirements under subparagraph (A) have been met, a Federal judge before whom a civil action with respect to prison conditions is pending who believes that a prison release order should be considered may sua sponte request the convening of a three-judge court to determine whether a prisoner release order should be entered.\n    (E) The three-judge court shall enter a prisoner release order only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that\u2014\n      (i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right; and\n      (ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.\n    (F) Any State or local official including a legislator or unit of government whose jurisdiction or function includes the appropriation of funds for the construction, operation, or maintenance of prison facilities, or the prosecution or custody of persons who may be released from, or not admitted to, a prison as a result of a prisoner release order shall have standing to oppose the imposition or continuation in effect of such relief and to seek termination of such relief, and shall have the right to intervene in any proceeding relating to such relief.\n(b) Termination of Relief.\u2014\n  (1) Termination of prospective relief.\u2014\n    (A) In any civil action with respect to prison conditions in which prospective relief is ordered, such relief shall be terminable upon the motion of any party or intervener\u2014\n      (i) 2 years after the date the court granted or approved the prospective relief;\n      (ii) 1 year after the date the court has entered an order denying termination of prospective relief under this paragraph; or\n      (iii) in the case of an order issued on or before the date of enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 2 years after such date of enactment.\n    (B) Nothing in this section shall prevent the parties from agreeing to terminate or modify relief before the relief is terminated under subparagraph (A).\n  (2) Immediate termination of prospective relief.\u2014 In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, a defendant or intervener shall be entitled to the immediate termination of any prospective relief if the relief was approved or granted in the absence of a finding by the court that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\n  (3) Limitation.\u2014 Prospective relief shall not terminate if the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.\n  (4) Termination or modification of relief.\u2014 Nothing in this section shall prevent any party or intervener from seeking modification or termination before the relief is terminable under paragraph (1) or (2), to the extent that modification or termination would otherwise be legally permissible.\n(c) Settlements.\u2014\n  (1) Consent decrees.\u2014 In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, the court shall not enter or approve a consent decree unless it complies with the limitations on relief set forth in subsection (a).\n  (2) Private settlement agreements.\u2014\n    (A) Nothing in this section shall preclude parties from entering into a private settlement agreement that does not comply with the limitations on relief set forth in subsection (a), if the terms of that agreement are not subject to court enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the agreement settled.\n    (B) Nothing in this section shall preclude any party claiming that a private settlement agreement has been breached from seeking in State court any remedy available under State law.\n(d) State Law Remedies.\u2014 The limitations on remedies in this section shall not apply to relief entered by a State court based solely upon claims arising under State law.\n(e) Procedure for Motions Affecting Prospective Relief.\u2014\n  (1) Generally.\u2014 The court shall promptly rule on any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief in a civil action with respect to prison conditions. Mandamus shall lie to remedy any failure to issue a prompt ruling on such a motion.\n  (2) Automatic stay.\u2014 Any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief made under subsection (b) shall operate as a stay during the period\u2014\n    (A)\n      (i) beginning on the 30th day after such motion is filed, in the case of a motion made under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b); or\n      (ii) beginning on the 180th day after such motion is filed, in the case of a motion made under any other law; and\n    (B) ending on the date the court enters a final order ruling on the motion.\n  (3) Postponement of automatic stay.\u2014 The court may postpone the effective date of an automatic stay specified in subsection (e)(2)(A) for not more than 60 days for good cause. No postponement shall be permissible because of general congestion of the court\u2019s calendar.\n  (4) Order blocking the automatic stay.\u2014 Any order staying, suspending, delaying, or barring the operation of the automatic stay described in paragraph (2) (other than an order to postpone the effective date of the automatic stay under paragraph (3)) shall be treated as an order refusing to dissolve or modify an injunction and shall be appealable pursuant to section 1292(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, regardless of how the order is styled or whether the order is termed a preliminary or a final ruling.\n(f) Special Masters.\u2014\n  (1) In general.\u2014\n    (A) In any civil action in a Federal court with respect to prison conditions, the court may appoint a special master who shall be disinterested and objective and who will give due regard to the public safety, to conduct hearings on the record and prepare proposed findings of fact.\n    (B) The court shall appoint a special master under this subsection during the remedial phase of the action only upon a finding that the remedial phase will be sufficiently complex to warrant the appointment.\n  (2) Appointment.\u2014\n    (A) If the court determines that the appointment of a special master is necessary, the court shall request that the defendant institution and the plaintiff each submit a list of not more than 5 persons to serve as a special master.\n    (B) Each party shall have the opportunity to remove up to 3 persons from the opposing party\u2019s list.\n    (C) The court shall select the master from the persons remaining on the list after the operation of subparagraph (B).\n  (3) Interlocutory appeal.\u2014 Any party shall have the right to an interlocutory appeal of the judge\u2019s selection of the special master under this subsection, on the ground of partiality.\n  (4) Compensation.\u2014 The compensation to be allowed to a special master under this section shall be based on an hourly rate not greater than the hourly rate established under section 3006A for payment of court-appointed counsel, plus costs reasonably incurred by the special master. Such compensation and costs shall be paid with funds appropriated to the Judiciary.\n  (5) Regular review of appointment.\u2014 In any civil action with respect to prison conditions in which a special master is appointed under this subsection, the court shall review the appointment of the special master every 6 months to determine whether the services of the special master continue to be required under paragraph (1). In no event shall the appointment of a special master extend beyond the termination of the relief.\n  (6) Limitations on powers and duties.\u2014 A special master appointed under this subsection\u2014\n    (A) may be authorized by a court to conduct hearings and prepare proposed findings of fact, which shall be made on the record;\n    (B) shall not make any findings or communications ex parte;\n    (C) may be authorized by a court to assist in the development of remedial plans; and\n    (D) may be removed at any time, but shall be relieved of the appointment upon the termination of relief.\n(g) Definitions.\u2014 As used in this section\u2014\n  (1) the term \u201cconsent decree\u201d means any relief entered by the court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties but does not include private settlements;\n  (2) the term \u201ccivil action with respect to prison conditions\u201d means any civil proceeding arising under Federal law with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of persons confined in prison, but does not include habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact or duration of confinement in prison;\n  (3) the term \u201cprisoner\u201d means any person subject to incarceration, detention, or admission to any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program;\n  (4) the term \u201cprisoner release order\u201d includes any order, including a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief, that has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population, or that directs the release from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison;\n  (5) the term \u201cprison\u201d means any Federal, State, or local facility that incarcerates or detains juveniles or adults accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law;\n  (6) the term \u201cprivate settlement agreement\u201d means an agreement entered into among the parties that is not subject to judicial enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the agreement settled;\n  (7) the term \u201cprospective relief\u201d means all relief other than compensatory monetary damages;\n  (8) the term \u201cspecial master\u201d means any person appointed by a Federal court pursuant to Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or pursuant to any inherent power of the court to exercise the powers of a master, regardless of the title or description given by the court; and\n  (9) the term \u201crelief\u201d means all relief in any form that may be granted or approved by the court, and includes consent decrees but does not include private settlement agreements.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above where the term \"prison\" is defined?
