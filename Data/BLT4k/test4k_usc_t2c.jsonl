No funds allocated to a State under this subsection or received by a State for distribution under subsection (b) may be distributed by the Attorney General or by the State involved for any program other than a program contained in an approved application.\n(b) Local distribution.\n  (1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (2), each State which receives funds under subsection (a)(1) in a fiscal year shall distribute among units of local government, for the purposes specified in section 10401 of this title, not less than 75 percent of such amounts received.\n  (2) Waiver.

If the State has reason to believe that the reported rate of part 1 violent crimes or juvenile justice expenditures for a unit of local government is insufficient or inaccurate, the State shall\u2014\n  (1) investigate the methodology used by the unit to determine the accuracy of the submitted data; and\n  (2) if necessary, use the best available comparable data regarding the number of violent crimes or juvenile justice expenditures for the relevant years for the unit of local government.\n(d) Local government with allocations less than $10,000. If under this section a unit of local government is allocated less than $10,000 for a payment period, the amount allotted shall be expended by the State on services to units of local government whose allotment is less than such amount in a manner consistent with this subchapter.\n(e) Direct grants to specially qualified units.\n  (1) In general. If a State does not qualify or apply for funds reserved for allocation under subsection (a) by the application deadline established by the Attorney General, the Attorney General shall reserve not more than 75 percent of the allocation that the State would have received under subsection (a) for such fiscal year to provide grants to specially qualified units which meet the requirements for funding under section 10403 of this title.\n  (2) Award basis.

Provisions applicable to producers.\n(a) Processor assurances.\n  (1) In general. If allotments for a crop year are allocated to processors under section 1359dd of this title, the Secretary shall obtain from the processors such assurances as the Secretary considers adequate that the allocation will be shared among producers served by the processor in a fair and equitable manner that adequately reflects producers\u2019 production histories.\n  (2) Arbitration.\n    (A) In general. Any dispute between a processor and a producer, or group of producers, with respect to the sharing of the allocation to the processor shall be resolved through arbitration by the Secretary on the request of either party.\n    (B) Period. The arbitration shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be\u2014\n      (i) commenced not more than 45 days after the request; and\n      (ii) completed not more than 60 days after the request.\n(b) Sugar beet processing facility closures.\n  (1) In general. If a sugar beet processing facility is closed and the sugar beet growers that previously delivered beets to the facility elect to deliver their beets to another processing company, the growers may petition the Secretary to modify allocations under this subpart to allow the delivery.\n  (2) Increased allocation for processing company. The Secretary may increase the allocation to the processing company to which the growers elect to deliver their sugar beets, with the approval of the processing company, to a level that does not exceed the processing capacity of the processing company, to accommodate the change in deliveries.\n  (3) Decreased allocation for closed company. The increased allocation shall be deducted from the allocation to the company that owned the processing facility that has been closed and the remaining allocation shall be unaffected.\n  (4) Timing. The determinations of the Secretary on the issues raised by the petition shall be made within 60 days after the filing of the petition.\n(c) Proportionate shares of certain allotments.\n  (1) Definition of seed.\n    (A) In general. In this subsection, the term \u201cseed\u201d means only those varieties of seed that are dedicated to the production of sugarcane from which is produced sugar for human consumption.\n    (B) Exclusion. The term \u201cseed\u201d does not include seed of a high-fiber cane variety dedicated to other uses, as determined by the Secretary.\n  (2) In general.\n    (A) States affected. In any case in which a State allotment is established under section 1359cc(f) of this title and there are in excess of 250 sugarcane producers in the State (other than Puerto Rico), the Secretary shall make a determination under subparagraph (B).\n    (B) Determination. The Secretary shall determine, for each State allotment described in subparagraph (A), whether the production of sugarcane, in the absence of proportionate shares, will be greater than the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar.\n  (3) Establishment of proportionate shares. If the Secretary determines under paragraph (2) that the quantity of sugar produced from sugarcane produced by producers in the area covered by a State allotment for a crop year will be in excess of the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the allotment for the crop year and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar, the Secretary shall establish a proportionate share for each sugarcane-producing farm that limits the acreage of sugarcane that may be harvested on the farm for sugar or seed during the crop year the allotment is in effect as provided in this subsection. Each such proportionate share shall be subject to adjustment under paragraph (8) and section 1359cc(g) of this title.\n  (4) Method of determining. For purposes of determining proportionate shares for any crop of sugarcane:\n    (A) The Secretary shall establish the State\u2019s per-acre yield goal for a crop of sugarcane at a level (not less than the average per-acre yield in the State for the 2 highest years from among the 1999, 2000, and 2001 crop years, as determined by the Secretary) that will ensure an adequate net return per pound to producers in the State, taking into consideration any available production research data that the Secretary considers relevant.\n    (B) The Secretary shall adjust the per-acre yield goal by the average recovery rate of sugar produced from sugarcane by processors in the State.\n    (C) The Secretary shall convert the State allotment for the crop year involved into a State acreage allotment for the crop by dividing the State allotment by the per-acre yield goal for the State, as established under subparagraph (A) and as further adjusted under subparagraph (B).\n    (D) The Secretary shall establish a uniform reduction percentage for the crop by dividing the State acreage allotment, as determined for the crop under subparagraph (C), by the sum of all adjusted acreage bases in the State, as determined by the Secretary.\n    (E) The uniform reduction percentage for the crop, as determined under subparagraph (D), shall be applied to the acreage base for each sugarcane-producing farm in the State to determine the farm\u2019s proportionate share of sugarcane acreage that may be harvested for sugar or seed.\n  (5) Acreage base. For purposes of this subsection, the acreage base for each sugarcane-producing farm shall be determined by the Secretary, as follows:\n    (A) The acreage base for any farm shall be the number of acres that is equal to the average of the acreage planted and considered planted for harvest for sugar or seed on the farm in the 2 highest of the 1999, 2000, and 2001 crop years.\n    (B) Acreage planted to sugarcane that producers on a farm were unable to harvest to sugarcane for sugar or seed because of drought, flood, other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the producers may be considered as harvested for the production of sugar or seed for purposes of this paragraph.\n  (6) Violation.\n    (A) In general. Whenever proportionate shares are in effect in a State for a crop of sugarcane, producers on a farm shall not knowingly harvest, or allow to be harvested, for sugar or seed an acreage of sugarcane in excess of the farm\u2019s proportionate share for the crop year, or otherwise violate proportionate share regulations issued by the Secretary under section 1359hh(a) of this title.\n    (B) Determination of violation. No producer shall be considered to have violated subparagraph (A) unless the processor of the sugarcane harvested by such producer from acreage in excess of the proportionate share of the farm markets an amount of sugar that exceeds the allocation of such processor for a crop year.\n    (C) Civil penalty. Any producer on a farm who violates subparagraph (A) by knowingly harvesting, or allowing to be harvested, an acreage of sugarcane for sugar in excess of the farm\u2019s proportionate share shall be liable to the Commodity Credit Corporation for a civil penalty equal to one and one-half times the United States market value of the quantity of sugar that is marketed by the processor of such sugarcane in excess of the allocation of such processor for the crop year. The Secretary shall prorate penalties imposed under this subparagraph in a fair and equitable manner among all the producers of sugarcane harvested from excess acreage that is acquired by such processor.\n  (7) Waiver. Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, the Secretary may authorize the county and State committees established under section 590h(b) of title 16 to waive or modify deadlines and other proportionate share requirements in cases in which lateness or failure to meet the other requirements does not affect adversely the operation of proportionate shares.\n  (8) Adjustments. Whenever the Secretary determines that, because of a natural disaster or other condition beyond the control of producers that adversely affects a crop of sugarcane subject to proportionate shares, the amount of sugar from sugarcane produced by producers subject to the proportionate shares will not be sufficient to enable processors in the State to meet the State\u2019s cane sugar allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar, the Secretary may uniformly allow producers to harvest an amount of sugarcane in excess of their proportionate share, or suspend proportionate shares entirely, as necessary to enable processors to meet the State allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory of sugar.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above of the text \"In general.

No information acquired from an electronic surveillance pursuant to this subchapter may be used or disclosed by Federal officers or employees except for lawful purposes.\n(b) Statement for disclosure. No information acquired pursuant to this subchapter shall be disclosed for law enforcement purposes unless such disclosure is accompanied by a statement that such information, or any information derived therefrom, may only be used in a criminal proceeding with the advance authorization of the Attorney General.\n(c) Notification by United States. Whenever the Government intends to enter into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United States, against an aggrieved person, any information obtained or derived from an electronic surveillance of that aggrieved person pursuant to the authority of this subchapter, the Government shall, prior to the trial, hearing, or other proceeding or at a reasonable time prior to an effort to so disclose or so use that information or submit it in evidence, notify the aggrieved person and the court or other authority in which the information is to be disclosed or used that the Government intends to so disclose or so use such information.\n(d) Notification by States or political subdivisions.

The rate of interest charged participants in this program shall not be less than the rate of interest charged by the Commodity Credit Corporation by the United States Treasury, except that the Secretary may waive or adjust the interest as the Secretary considers appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this section.\n(d) Storage payments.\n  (1) In general. The Secretary shall provide storage payments to producers for storage of wheat or feed grains under the program established in this section in such amounts and under such conditions as the Secretary determines appropriate to encourage producers to participate in the program.\n  (2) Timing. The Secretary shall make storage payments available to participants in this program at the end of each quarter.\n  (3) Duration. The Secretary shall cease making storage payments whenever the price of wheat or feed grains is equal to or exceeds 95 percent of the then current established price for the commodities, and for any 90-day period immediately following the last day on which the price of wheat or feed grains was equal to or in excess of 95 percent of the then current established price for the commodities.\n(e) Emergencies. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may require producers to repay loans made under this section, plus accrued interest and such other charges as may be required by regulation prior to the maturity date thereof, if the Secretary determines that emergency conditions exist that require that the commodity be made available in the market to meet urgent domestic or international needs and the Secretary reports the determination and the reasons for the determination to the President, the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate at least 14 days before taking the action.\n(f) Quantity of commodities in program.

In the announcement, the Secretary shall specify the maximum quantity of wheat or feed grains to be stored under this program that the Secretary determines appropriate to promote the orderly marketing of the commodities.\n(h) Discretionary exit. A producer may repay a loan extended under this section at any time.\n(i) Reconcentration of grain. The Secretary may, with the concurrence of the owner of grain stored under this program, reconcentrate all such grain stored in commercial warehouses at such points as the Secretary considers to be in the public interest, taking into account such factors as transportation and normal marketing patterns. The Secretary shall permit rotation of stocks and facilitate maintenance of quality under regulations that assure that the holding producer or warehouseman shall, at all times, have available for delivery at the designated place of storage both the quantity and quality of grain covered by the producer\u2019s or warehouseman\u2019s commitment.\n(j) Management of grain. Whenever grain is stored under this section, the Secretary may buy and sell at an equivalent price, allowing for the customary location and grade differentials, substantially equivalent quantities of grain in different locations or warehouses to the extent needed to properly handle, rotate, distribute, and locate the commodities that the Commodity Credit Corporation owns or controls. The purchases to offset sales shall be made within 2 market days following the sales. The Secretary shall make a daily list available showing the price, location, and quantity of the transactions.\n(k) Use of Commodity Credit Corporation.

To the maximum extent practicable consistent with the fulfillment of the purposes of this section and the effective and efficient administration of this section, the Secretary shall utilize the usual and customary channels, facilities, and arrangements of trade and commerce.\n(l) Use of commodity certificates. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a producer has substituted purchased or other commodities for the commodities originally pledged as collateral for a loan made under this section, the Secretary may allow a producer to repay the loan using a generic commodity certificate that may be exchanged for commodities owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation, if the substitute commodities have been pledged as loan collateral and redeemed only within the same county.\n(m) Additional authority. The authority provided by this section shall be in addition to other authorities available to the Secretary for carrying out producer loan and storage operations.\n(n) Regulations. The Secretary of Agriculture shall issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out this section not later than 60 days after November 28, 1990.\n(o) Review. In announcing the terms and conditions of the producer storage program under this section, the Secretary shall review standards concerning the quality of grain that shall be allowed to be stored under the program, and such standards should encourage only quality grain, as determined by the Secretary, to be pledged as collateral for such loans. The Secretary shall review inspection, maintenance, and stock rotation requirements and take the necessary steps to maintain the quality of such grain.\n(p) Crops. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section shall become effective December 1, 1990.\n\n\u00a7 357. Assumption of liability.\n(a) General rule. Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), if\u2014\n  (1) the taxpayer receives property which would be permitted to be received under section 351 or 361 without the recognition of gain if it were the sole consideration, and\n  (2) as part of the consideration, another party to the exchange assumes a liability of the taxpayer,\nthen such assumption shall not be treated as money or other property, and shall not prevent the exchange from being within the provisions of section 351 or 361, as the case may be.\n(b) Tax avoidance purpose.\n  (1) In general. If, taking into consideration the nature of the liability and the circumstances in the light of which the arrangement for the assumption was made, it appears that the principal purpose of the taxpayer with respect to the assumption described in subsection (a)\u2014\n    (A) was a purpose to avoid Federal income tax on the exchange, or\n    (B) if not such purpose, was not a bona fide business purpose,\n  then such assumption (in the total amount of the liability assumed pursuant to such exchange) shall, for purposes of section 351 or 361 (as the case may be), be considered as money received by the taxpayer on the exchange.\n  (2) Burden of proof. In any suit or proceeding where the burden is on the taxpayer to prove such assumption is not to be treated as money received by the taxpayer, such burden shall not be considered as sustained unless the taxpayer sustains such burden by the clear preponderance of the evidence.\n(c) Liabilities in excess of basis.\n  (1) In general. In the case of an exchange\u2014\n    (A) to which section 351 applies, or\n    (B) to which section 361 applies by reason of a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(D) with respect to which stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 355,\n  if the sum of the amount of the liabilities assumed exceeds the total of the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be.\n  (2) Exceptions. Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any exchange\u2014\n    (A) to which subsection (b)(1) of this section applies, or\n    (B) which is pursuant to a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(G) where no former shareholder of the transferor corporation receives any consideration for his stock.\n  (3) Certain liabilities excluded.\n    (A) In general. If a taxpayer transfers, in an exchange to which section 351 applies, a liability the payment of which either\u2014\n      (i) would give rise to a deduction, or\n      (ii) would be described in section 736(a),\n    then, for purposes of paragraph (1), the amount of such liability shall be excluded in determining the amount of liabilities assumed.\n    (B) Exception. Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any liability to the extent that the incurrence of the liability resulted in the creation of, or an increase in, the basis of any property.\n(d) Determination of amount of liability assumed.\n  (1) In general. For purposes of this section, section 358(d), section 358(h), section 361(b)(3), section 362(d), section 368(a)(1)(C), and section 368(a)(2)(B), except as provided in regulations\u2014\n    (A) a recourse liability (or portion thereof) shall be treated as having been assumed if, as determined on the basis of all facts and circumstances, the transferee has agreed to, and is expected to, satisfy such liability (or portion), whether or not the transferor has been relieved of such liability; and\n    (B) except to the extent provided in paragraph (2), a nonrecourse liability shall be treated as having been assumed by the transferee of any asset subject to such liability.\n  (2) Exception for nonrecourse liability. The amount of the nonrecourse liability treated as described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be reduced by the lesser of\u2014\n    (A) the amount of such liability which an owner of other assets not transferred to the transferee and also subject to such liability has agreed with the transferee to, and is expected to, satisfy; or\n    (B) the fair market value of such other assets (determined without regard to section 7701(g)).\n  (3) Regulations. The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection and section 362(d). The Secretary may also prescribe regulations which provide that the manner in which a liability is treated as assumed under this subsection is applied, where appropriate, elsewhere in this title.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above of the text \"The maximum quantities of wheat may not be established at less than 300 million bushels, nor more than 450 million bushels.\"?

Bridges on Federal dams.\n(a) Each executive department, independent establishment, office, board, bureau, commission, authority, administration, corporation wholly owned or controlled by the United States, or other agency of the Government of the United States, hereinafter collectively and individually referred to as \u201cagency\u201d, which on or after July 29, 1946, has jurisdiction over and custody of any dam constructed or to be constructed and owned by or for the United States, is authorized, with any funds available to it, to design and construct any such dam in such manner that it will constitute and serve as a suitable and adequate foundation to support a public highway bridge upon and across such dam, and to design and construct upon the foundation thus provided a public highway bridge upon and across such dam. The highway department of the State in which such dam shall be located, jointly with the Secretary, shall first determine and certify to such agency that such bridge is economically desirable and needed as a link in the State or Federal-aid highway systems, and shall request such agency to design and construct such dam so that it will serve as a suitable and adequate foundation for a public highway bridge and to design and construct such public highway bridge upon and across such dam, and shall agree to reimburse such agency pursuant to subsection (d) of this section for any additional costs which it may be required to incur because of the design and construction of such dam so that it will serve as a foundation for a public highway bridge and for expenditures which it may find it necessary to make in designing and constructing such public highway bridge upon and across such dam. In no case shall the design and construction of a bridge upon and across such dam be undertaken hereunder except by the agency having jurisdiction over and custody of the dam, acting directly or through contractors employed by it, and after such agency shall determine that it will be structurally feasible and will not interfere with the proper functioning and operation of the dam.\n(b) Construction of any bridge upon and across any dam pursuant to this section shall not be commenced unless and until the State in which such bridge is to be located, or the appropriate subdivision of such State, shall enter into an agreement with such agency and with the Secretary to construct, or cause to be constructed, with or without the aid of Federal funds, the approach roads necessary to connect such bridge with existing public highways and to maintain, or cause to be maintained, such approach roads from and after their completion. Such agreement may also provide for the design and construction of such bridge upon and across the dam by such agency of the United States and for reimbursing such agency the costs incurred by it in the design and construction of the bridge as provided in subsection (d) of this section. Any such agency is hereby authorized to convey to the State, or to the appropriate subdivision thereof, without costs, such easements and rights-of-way in its custody or over lands of the United States in its custody and control as may be necessary, convenient, or proper for the location, construction, and maintenance of the approach roads referred to in this section including such roadside parks or recreational areas of limited size as may be deemed necessary for the accommodation of the traveling public. Any bridge constructed pursuant to this section upon and across a dam in the custody and jurisdiction of any agency of the United States, including such portion thereof, if any, as may extend beyond the physical limits of the dam, shall constitute and remain a part of said dam and be maintained by the agency. Any such agency may enter into any such contracts and agreements with the State or its subdivisions respecting public use of any bridge so located and constructed as may be deemed appropriate, but no such bridge shall be closed to public use by the agency except in cases of emergency or when deemed necessary in the interest of national security.\n(c) All costs and expenses incurred and expenditures made by any agency in the exercise of the powers and authority conferred by this section (but not including any costs, expenses, or expenditures which would have been required in any event to satisfy a legal road or bridge relocation obligation or to meet operating or other agency needs) shall be recorded and kept separate and apart from the other costs, expenses, and expenditures of such agency, and no portion thereof shall be charged or allocated to flood control, navigation, irrigation, fertilizer production, the national defense, the development of power, or other program, purpose, or function of such agency.\n(d) Not to exceed $65,000,000 of any money heretofore or hereafter appropriated for expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this title or prior Acts shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of this section, as an emergency fund, to reimburse any agency for any additional costs or expenditures which it may be required to incur because of the design and construction of any such dam so that it will constitute and serve as a foundation for a public highway bridge upon and across such dam and to reimburse any such agency for any costs, expenses, or expenditures which it may be required to make in designing and constructing any such bridge upon and across a dam in accordance with the provisions of this section, except such costs, expenses, or expenditures as would have been required of such agency in any event to satisfy a legal obligation to relocate a highway or bridge or to meet operating or other agency needs, and there is authorized to be appropriated any sum or sums necessary to reimburse the funds so expended by the Secretary from time to time under the authority of this section. Of each bridge constructed upon and across a dam under the provisions of this section, there may be financed wholly with Federal funds that portion thereof which is located within the physical limits of the masonry structure, or structures, of the dam, and the Secretary shall in his sole discretion determine what additional portion of the bridge, if any, may be so financed, such determination to be final and conclusive. The remainder of the bridge, and any necessary related approach roads, shall be financed by the State or its appropriate subdivision with or without the aid of Federal funds; but said portion of the bridge so financed by the State or its subdivisions, including such portion thereof, if any, as may extend beyond the physical limits of the dam, shall nevertheless be designed and constructed solely by the agency having custody and jurisdiction of the dam as provided in subsection (a) of this section.\n(e) In making, reviewing, or approving the design of any bridge or approach structure to be constructed under this section, the agency shall, in matters relating to roadway design, loadings, clearances and widths, and traffic safeguards, give full consideration to and be guided by the standards and advice of the Secretary.\n(f) The authority conferred by this section shall be in addition to and not in limitation of authority conferred upon any agency by any other law, and nothing in this section contained shall affect or be deemed to relate to any bridge, approach structure, or highway constructed or to be constructed by any such agency in furtherance of its lawful purposes and requirements or to satisfy a legal obligation incurred independently of this section.\n\n\u00a7 238q. Liability regarding emergency use of automated external defibrillators.\n(a) Good Samaritan protections regarding AEDs. Except as provided in subsection (b), any person who uses or attempts to use an automated external defibrillator device on a victim of a perceived medical emergency is immune from civil liability for any harm resulting from the use or attempted use of such device; and in addition, any person who acquired the device is immune from such liability, if the harm was not due to the failure of such acquirer of the device\u2014\n  (1) to notify local emergency response personnel or other appropriate entities of the most recent placement of the device within a reasonable period of time after the device was placed;\n  (2) to properly maintain and test the device; or\n  (3) to provide appropriate training in the use of the device to an employee or agent of the acquirer when the employee or agent was the person who used the device on the victim, except that such requirement of training does not apply if\u2014\n    (A) the employee or agent was not an employee or agent who would have been reasonably expected to use the device; or\n    (B) the period of time elapsing between the engagement of the person as an employee or agent and the occurrence of the harm (or between the acquisition of the device and the occurrence of the harm, in any case in which the device was acquired after such engagement of the person) was not a reasonably sufficient period in which to provide the training.\n(b) Inapplicability of immunity. Immunity under subsection (a) does not apply to a person if\u2014\n  (1) the harm involved was caused by willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the victim who was harmed;\n  (2) the person is a licensed or certified health professional who used the automated external defibrillator device while acting within the scope of the license or certification of the professional and within the scope of the employment or agency of the professional;\n  (3) the person is a hospital, clinic, or other entity whose purpose is providing health care directly to patients, and the harm was caused by an employee or agent of the entity who used the device while acting within the scope of the employment or agency of the employee or agent; or\n  (4) the person is an acquirer of the device who leased the device to a health care entity (or who otherwise provided the device to such entity for compensation without selling the device to the entity), and the harm was caused by an employee or agent of the entity who used the device while acting within the scope of the employment or agency of the employee or agent.\n(c) Rules of construction.\n  (1) In general. The following applies with respect to this section:\n    (A) This section does not establish any cause of action, or require that an automated external defibrillator device be placed at any building or other location.\n    (B) With respect to a class of persons for which this section provides immunity from civil liability, this section supersedes the law of a State only to the extent that the State has no statute or regulations that provide persons in such class with immunity for civil liability arising from the use by such persons of automated external defibrillator devices in emergency situations (within the meaning of the State law or regulation involved).\n    (C) This section does not waive any protection from liability for Federal officers or employees under\u2014\n      (i) section 233 of this title; or\n      (ii) sections 1346(b), 2672, and 2679 of title 28 or under alternative benefits provided by the United States where the availability of such benefits precludes a remedy under section 1346(b) of title 28.\n  (2) Civil actions under Federal law.\n    (A) In general. The applicability of subsections (a) and (b) includes applicability to any action for civil liability described in subsection (a) that arises under Federal law.\n    (B) Federal areas adopting State law. If a geographic area is under Federal jurisdiction and is located within a State but out of the jurisdiction of the State, and if, pursuant to Federal law, the law of the State applies in such area regarding matters for which there is no applicable Federal law, then an action for civil liability described in subsection (a) that in such area arises under the law of the State is subject to subsections (a) through (c) in lieu of any related State law that would apply in such area in the absence of this subparagraph.\n(d) Federal jurisdiction. In any civil action arising under State law, the courts of the State involved have jurisdiction to apply the provisions of this section exclusive of the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.\n(e) Definitions.\n  (1) Perceived medical emergency. For purposes of this section, the term \u201cperceived medical emergency\u201d means circumstances in which the behavior of an individual leads a reasonable person to believe that the individual is experiencing a life-threatening medical condition that requires an immediate medical response regarding the heart or other cardiopulmonary functioning of the individual.\n  (2) Other definitions.

Forest development roads: prohibition on credits; inclusion of construction costs in notice of sale; special election by small business concerns; construction standards; authorization of harvesting; treatment of road value.\n(a) Prohibition on timber purchaser road credits. In financing any forest development road pursuant to section 535 of this title, the Secretary of Agriculture may not provide effective credit for road construction to any purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products.\n(b) Construction of roads by timber purchasers.\n  (1) Whenever the Secretary of Agriculture makes a determination that a forest development road referred to in subsection (a) shall be constructed or paid for, in whole or in part, by a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products, the Secretary shall include notice of the determination in the notice of sale of the timber or other forest products. The notice of sale shall contain, or announce the availability of, sufficient information related to the road described in the notice to permit a prospective bidder on the sale to calculate the likely cost that would be incurred by the bidder to construct or finance the construction of the road so that the bidder may reflect such cost in the bid.\n  (2) If there is an increase or decrease in the cost of roads constructed by the timber purchaser, caused by variations in quantities, changes or modifications subsequent to the sale of timber made in accordance with applicable timber sale contract provisions, then an adjustment to the price paid for timber harvested by the purchaser shall be made. The adjustment shall be applied by the Secretary as soon as practicable after any such design change is implemented.\n(c) Special election by small business concerns.\n  (1) A notice of sale referred to in subsection (b) containing specified road construction of $50,000 or more, shall give a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products that qualifies as a \u201csmall business concern\u201d under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.), and regulations issued thereunder, the option to elect that the Secretary of Agriculture build the roads described in the notice. The Secretary shall provide the small business concern with an estimate of the cost that would be incurred by the Secretary to construct the roads on behalf of the small business concern. The notice of sale shall also include the date on which the roads described in the notice will be completed by the Secretary if the election is made.\n  (2) If the election referred to in paragraph (1) is made, the purchaser of the national forest timber or other forest products shall pay to the Secretary of Agriculture, in addition to the price paid for the timber or other forest products, an amount equal to the estimated cost of the roads which otherwise would be paid by the purchaser as provided in the notice of sale. Pending receipt of such amount, the Secretary may use receipts from the sale of national forest timber or other forest products and such additional sums as may be appropriated for the construction of roads, such funds to be available until expended, to accomplish the requested road construction.\n(d) Authorization of harvesting. In each sale of national forest timber or other forest products referred to in this section, the Secretary of Agriculture is encouraged to authorize harvest of the timber or other forest products in a unit included in the sale as soon as road work for that unit is completed and the road work is approved by the Secretary.\n(e) Construction standard. For any forest development road that is to be constructed or paid for by a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products, the Secretary of Agriculture may not require the purchaser to design, construct, or maintain the road (or pay for the design, construction, or maintenance of the road) to a standard higher than the standard, consistent with applicable environmental laws and regulations, that is sufficient for the harvesting and removal of the timber or other forest products, unless the Secretary bears that part of the cost necessary to meet the higher standard.\n(f) Treatment of road value. For any forest development road that is constructed or paid for by a purchaser of national forest timber or other forest products, the estimated cost of the road construction, including subsequent design changes, shall be considered to be money received for purposes of the payments required to be made under section 500 of this title. To the extent that the appraised value of road construction determined under this subsection reflects funds contributed by the Secretary of Agriculture to build the road to a higher standard pursuant to subsection (e), the Secretary shall modify the appraisal of the road construction to exclude the effect of the Federal funds.\n(g) Effective date.\n  (1) This section and the requirements of this section shall take effect (and apply thereafter) upon the earlier of\u2014\n    (A) April 1, 1999; or\n    (B) the date that is the later of\u2014\n      (i) the effective date of regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture to implement this section; and\n      (ii) the date on which new timber sale contract provisions designed to implement this section, that have been published for public comment, are approved by the Secretary.\n  (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), any sale of national forest timber or other forest products for which notice of sale is provided before the effective date of this section, and any effective purchaser road credit earned pursuant to a contract resulting from such a notice of sale or otherwise earned before that effective date shall remain in effect, and shall continue to be subject to section 535 of this title and section 472a(i) of this title, and rules issued thereunder, as in effect on the day before October 21, 1998.\n\n\u00a7 288\u20134.

Such cessation order shall remain in effect until the Secretary or his authorized representative determines that the condition, practice, or violation has been abated, or until modified, vacated, or terminated by the Secretary or his authorized representative pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection. Where the Secretary finds that the ordered cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations, or any portion thereof, will not completely abate the imminent danger to health or safety of the public or the significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the Secretary shall, in addition to the cessation order, impose affirmative obligations on the operator requiring him to take whatever steps the Secretary deems necessary to abate the imminent danger or the significant environmental harm.\n  (3) When, on the basis of a Federal inspection which is carried out during the enforcement of a Federal program or a Federal lands program, Federal inspection pursuant to section 1252, or section 1254(b) of this title, or during Federal enforcement of a State program in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary or his authorized representative determines that any permittee is in violation of any requirement of this chapter or any permit condition required by this chapter; but such violation does not create an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, or cannot be reasonably expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the Secretary or authorized representative shall issue a notice to the permittee or his agent fixing a reasonable time but not more than ninety days for the abatement of the violation and providing opportunity for public hearing. If, upon expiration of the period of time as originally fixed or subsequently extended, for good cause shown and upon the written finding of the Secretary or his authorized representative, the Secretary or his authorized representative finds that the violation has not been abated, he shall immediately order a cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations or the portion thereof relevant to the violation.

Modern rate regulation.\n(a) Authority Generally.\u2014 The Postal Regulatory Commission shall, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this section, by regulation establish (and may from time to time thereafter by regulation revise) a modern system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products.\n(b) Objectives.\u2014 Such system shall be designed to achieve the following objectives, each of which shall be applied in conjunction with the others:\n  (1) To maximize incentives to reduce costs and increase efficiency.\n  (2) To create predictability and stability in rates.\n  (3) To maintain high quality service standards established under section 3691.\n  (4) To allow the Postal Service pricing flexibility.\n  (5) To assure adequate revenues, including retained earnings, to maintain financial stability.\n  (6) To reduce the administrative burden and increase the transparency of the ratemaking process.\n  (7) To enhance mail security and deter terrorism.\n  (8) To establish and maintain a just and reasonable schedule for rates and classifications, however the objective under this paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the Postal Service from making changes of unequal magnitude within, between, or among classes of mail.\n  (9) To allocate the total institutional costs of the Postal Service appropriately between market-dominant and competitive products.\n(c) Factors.\u2014 In establishing or revising such system, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall take into account\u2014\n  (1) the value of the mail service actually provided each class or type of mail service to both the sender and the recipient, including but not limited to the collection, mode of transportation, and priority of delivery;\n  (2) the requirement that each class of mail or type of mail service bear the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to each class or type of mail service through reliably identified causal relationships plus that portion of all other costs of the Postal Service reasonably assignable to such class or type;\n  (3) the effect of rate increases upon the general public, business mail users, and enterprises in the private sector of the economy engaged in the delivery of mail matter other than letters;\n  (4) the available alternative means of sending and receiving letters and other mail matter at reasonable costs;\n  (5) the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service;\n  (6) simplicity of structure for the entire schedule and simple, identifiable relationships between the rates or fees charged the various classes of mail for postal services;\n  (7) the importance of pricing flexibility to encourage increased mail volume and operational efficiency;\n  (8) the relative value to the people of the kinds of mail matter entered into the postal system and the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail;\n  (9) the importance of providing classifications with extremely high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery and of providing those that do not require high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery;\n  (10) the desirability of special classifications for both postal users and the Postal Service in accordance with the policies of this title, including agreements between the Postal Service and postal users, when available on public and reasonable terms to similarly situated mailers, that\u2014\n    (A) either\u2014\n      (i) improve the net financial position of the Postal Service through reducing Postal Service costs or increasing the overall contribution to the institutional costs of the Postal Service; or\n      (ii) enhance the performance of mail preparation, processing, transportation, or other functions; and\n    (B) do not cause unreasonable harm to the marketplace.\n  (11) the educational, cultural, scientific, and informational value to the recipient of mail matter;\n  (12) the need for the Postal Service to increase its efficiency and reduce its costs, including infrastructure costs, to help maintain high quality, affordable postal services;\n  (13) the value to the Postal Service and postal users of promoting intelligent mail and of secure, sender-identified mail; and\n  (14) the policies of this title as well as such other factors as the Commission determines appropriate.\n(d) Requirements.\u2014\n  (1) In general.\u2014 The system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products shall\u2014\n    (A) include an annual limitation on the percentage changes in rates to be set by the Postal Regulatory Commission that will be equal to the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers unadjusted for seasonal variation over the most recent available 12-month period preceding the date the Postal Service files notice of its intention to increase rates;\n    (B) establish a schedule whereby rates, when necessary and appropriate, would change at regular intervals by predictable amounts;\n    (C) not later than 45 days before the implementation of any adjustment in rates under this section, including adjustments made under subsection (c)(10)\u2014\n      (i) require the Postal Service to provide public notice of the adjustment;\n      (ii) provide an opportunity for review by the Postal Regulatory Commission;\n      (iii) provide for the Postal Regulatory Commission to notify the Postal Service of any noncompliance of the adjustment with the limitation under subparagraph (A); and\n      (iv) require the Postal Service to respond to the notice provided under clause (iii) and describe the actions to be taken to comply with the limitation under subparagraph (A);\n    (D) establish procedures whereby the Postal Service may adjust rates not in excess of the annual limitations under subparagraph (A); and\n    (E) notwithstanding any limitation set under subparagraphs (A) and (C), and provided there is not sufficient unused rate authority under paragraph (2)(C), establish procedures whereby rates may be adjusted on an expedited basis due to either extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, provided that the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing and comment, and within 90 days after any request by the Postal Service, that such adjustment is reasonable and equitable and necessary to enable the Postal Service, under best practices of honest, efficient, and economical management, to maintain and continue the development of postal services of the kind and quality adapted to the needs of the United States.\n  (2) Limitations.\u2014\n    (A) Classes of mail.\u2014 Except as provided under subparagraph (C), the annual limitations under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply to a class of mail, as defined in the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule as in effect on the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act.\n    (B) Rounding of rates and fees.\u2014 Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Postal Service from rounding rates and fees to the nearest whole integer, if the effect of such rounding does not cause the overall rate increase for any class to exceed the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.\n    (C) Use of unused rate authority.\u2014\n      (i) Definition.\u2014 In this subparagraph, the term \u201cunused rate adjustment authority\u201d means the difference between\u2014\n        (I) the maximum amount of a rate adjustment that the Postal Service is authorized to make in any year subject to the annual limitation under paragraph (1); and\n        (II) the amount of the rate adjustment the Postal Service actually makes in that year.\n      (ii) Authority.\u2014 Subject to clause (iii), the Postal Service may use any unused rate adjustment authority for any of the 5 years following the year such authority occurred.\n      (iii) Limitations.\u2014 In exercising the authority under clause (ii) in any year, the Postal Service\u2014\n        (I) may use unused rate adjustment authority from more than 1 year;\n        (II) may use any part of the unused rate adjustment authority from any year;\n        (III) shall use the unused rate adjustment authority from the earliest year such authority first occurred and then each following year; and\n        (IV) for any class or service, may not exceed the annual limitation under paragraph (1) by more than 2 percentage points.\n  (3) Review.\u2014 Ten years after the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act and as appropriate thereafter, the Commission shall review the system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products established under this section to determine if the system is achieving the objectives in subsection (b), taking into account the factors in subsection (c). If the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for public comment, that the system is not achieving the objectives in subsection (b), taking into account the factors in subsection (c), the Commission may, by regulation, make such modification or adopt such alternative system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products as necessary to achieve the objectives.\n(e) Workshare Discounts.\u2014\n  (1) Definition.\u2014 In this subsection, the term \u201cworkshare discount\u201d refers to rate discounts provided to mailers for the presorting, prebarcoding, handling, or transportation of mail, as further defined by the Postal Regulatory Commission under subsection (a).\n  (2) Scope.\u2014 The Postal Regulatory Commission shall ensure that such discounts do not exceed the cost that the Postal Service avoids as a result of workshare activity, unless\u2014\n    (A) the discount is\u2014\n      (i) associated with a new postal service, a change to an existing postal service, or with a new work share initiative related to an existing postal service; and\n      (ii) necessary to induce mailer behavior that furthers the economically efficient operation of the Postal Service and the portion of the discount in excess of the cost that the Postal Service avoids as a result of the workshare activity will be phased out over a limited period of time;\n    (B) the amount of the discount above costs avoided\u2014\n      (i) is necessary to mitigate rate shock; and\n      (ii) will be phased out over time;\n    (C) the discount is provided in connection with subclasses of mail consisting exclusively of mail matter of educational, cultural, scientific, or informational value; or\n    (D) reduction or elimination of the discount would impede the efficient operation of the Postal Service.\n  (3) Limitation.\u2014 Nothing in this subsection shall require that a work share discount be reduced or eliminated if the reduction or elimination of the discount would\u2014\n    (A) lead to a loss of volume in the affected category or subclass of mail and reduce the aggregate contribution to the institutional costs of the Postal Service from the category or subclass subject to the discount below what it otherwise would have been if the discount had not been reduced or eliminated; or\n    (B) result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the discount.\n  (4) Report.\u2014 Whenever the Postal Service establishes a workshare discount rate, the Postal Service shall, at the time it publishes the workshare discount rate, submit to the Postal Regulatory Commission a detailed report that\u2014\n    (A) explains the Postal Service\u2019s reasons for establishing the rate;\n    (B) sets forth the data, economic analyses, and other information relied on by the Postal Service to justify the rate; and\n    (C) certifies that the discount will not adversely affect rates or services provided to users of postal services who do not take advantage of the discount rate.\n(f) Transition Rule.\u2014 For the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this section, rates and classes for market-dominant products shall remain subject to modification in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and section 407, as such provisions were last in effect before the date of enactment of this section. Proceedings initiated to consider a request for a recommended decision filed by the Postal Service during that 1-year period shall be completed in accordance with subchapter II of chapter 36 of this title and implementing regulations, as in effect before the date of enactment of this section.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above of the text \"the maximum amount of a rate adjustment that the Postal Service is authorized to make in any year subject to the annual limitation under paragraph (1); and\"?

If the person has a service obligation under section 651 of this title or under any other provision of law that is not completed at the time the person is discharged or released from active duty, the three-year obligation under this subsection shall begin on the day after the date on which the person completes the person\u2019s obligation under such section or other provision of law.\n    (B) Each person who enters into an agreement referred to in subparagraph (A) who is not already a Reserve of an armed force and who is qualified shall, upon such person\u2019s discharge or release from active duty, be enlisted or appointed, as appropriate, as a Reserve and be transferred to a reserve component.\n  (2) A member who is discharged or released from active duty is not eligible for separation pay under this section if the member\u2014\n    (A) is discharged or released from active duty at his request;\n    (B) is discharged or released from active duty during an initial term of enlistment or an initial period of obligated service, unless the member is an officer discharged or released under the authority of section 647 of this title;\n    (C) is released from active duty for training; or\n    (D) upon discharge or release from active duty, is immediately eligible for retired or retainer pay based on his military service.\n(f) Counting Fractional Years of Service.\u2014 In determining a member\u2019s years of active service for the purpose of computing separation pay under this section, each full month of service that is in addition to the number of full years of service creditable to the member is counted as one-twelfth of a year and any remaining fractional part of a month is disregarded.\n(g) Coordination With Other Separation or Severance Pay Benefits.\u2014 A period for which a member has previously received separation pay under this section or severance pay or readjustment pay under any other provision of law based on service in the armed forces may not be included in determining the years of service that may be counted in computing the separation pay of the member under this section.\n(h) Coordination With Retired or Retainer Pay and Disability Compensation.\u2014\n  (1) A member who has received separation pay under this section, or separation pay, severance pay, or readjustment pay under any other provision of law, based on service in the armed forces, and who later qualifies for retired or retainer pay under this title or title 14 shall have deducted from each payment of such retired or retainer pay an amount, in such schedule of monthly installments as the Secretary of Defense shall specify, taking into account the financial ability of the member to pay and avoiding the imposition of undue financial hardship on the member and member\u2019s dependents, until the total amount deducted is equal to the total amount of separation pay, severance pay, and readjustment pay so paid.\n  (2) A member who has received separation pay under this section, or severance pay or readjustment pay under any other provision of law, based on service in the armed forces shall not be deprived, by reason of his receipt of such separation pay, severance pay, or readjustment pay, of any disability compensation to which he is entitled under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, but there shall be deducted from that disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of separation pay, severance pay, and readjustment pay received, less the amount of Federal income tax withheld from such pay (such withholding being at the flat withholding rate for Federal income tax withholding, as in effect pursuant to regulations prescribed under chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no deduction may be made from disability compensation for the amount of any separation pay, severance pay, or readjustment pay received because of an earlier discharge or release from a period of active duty if the disability which is the basis for that disability compensation was incurred or aggravated during a later period of active duty.\n(i) Special Rule for Members Receiving Sole Survivorship Discharge.\u2014\n  (1) A member of the armed forces who receives a sole survivorship discharge shall be entitled to separation pay under this section even though the member has completed less than six years of active service immediately before that discharge. Subsection (e) shall not apply to a member who receives a sole survivorship discharge.\n  (2) The amount of the separation pay to be paid to a member pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the years of active service actually completed by the member before the member\u2019s sole survivorship discharge.\n  (3) In this subsection, the term \u201csole survivorship discharge\u201d means the separation of a member from the armed forces, at the request of the member, pursuant to the Department of Defense policy permitting the early separation of a member who is the only surviving child in a family in which\u2014\n    (A) the father or mother or one or more siblings\u2014\n      (i) served in the armed forces; and\n      (ii) was killed, died as a result of wounds, accident, or disease, is in a captured or missing in action status, or is permanently 100 percent disabled or hospitalized on a continuing basis (and is not employed gainfully because of the disability or hospitalization); and\n    (B) the death, status, or disability did not result from the intentional misconduct or willful neglect of the parent or sibling and was not incurred during a period of unauthorized absence.\n(j) Regulations; Crediting of Other Commissioned Service.\u2014\n  (1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations, which shall be uniform for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Space Force, for the administration of this section.\n  (2) Active commissioned service in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or the Public Health Service shall be credited as active service in the armed forces for the purposes of this section.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above of the text \"one-half of the amount computed under clause (1).\"?

If interest is payable under paragraph (1) on any advance (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the \u201cfirst advance\u201d) by reason of another advance made to such State after September 30 of the calendar year in which the first advance was made, interest on such first advance attributable to periods before such September 30 shall be paid not later than the day after the date on which the other advance was made.\n    (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), in the case of any advance made during the last 5 months of any fiscal year, interest on such advance attributable to periods during such fiscal year shall not be required to be paid before the last day of the succeeding taxable year. Any interest the time for payment of which is deferred by the preceding sentence shall bear interest in the same manner as if it were an advance made on the day on which it would have been required to be paid but for this subparagraph.\n    (C)\n      (i) In the case of any State which meets the requirements of clause (ii) for any calendar year, any interest otherwise required to be paid under this subsection during such calendar year shall be paid as follows\u2014\n        (I) 25 percent of the amount otherwise required to be paid on or before any day during such calendar year shall be paid on or before such day; and\n        (II) 25 percent of the amount otherwise required to be paid on or before such day shall be paid on or before the corresponding day in each of the 3 succeeding calendar years.\n      No interest shall accrue on such deferred interest.\n      (ii) A State meets the requirements of this clause for any calendar year if the rate of insured unemployment (as determined for purposes of section 203 of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970) under the State law of the period consisting of the first 6 months of the preceding calendar year equaled or exceeded 7.5 percent.\n  (4) The interest rate determined under this paragraph with respect to any calendar year is a percentage (but not in excess of 10 percent) determined by dividing\u2014\n    (A) the aggregate amount credited under section 1104(e) of this title to State accounts on the last day of the last calendar quarter of the immediately preceding calendar year, by\n    (B) the aggregate of the average daily balances of the State accounts for such quarter as determined under section 1104(e) of this title.\n  (5) Interest required to be paid under paragraph (1) shall not be paid (directly or indirectly) by a State from amounts in its unemployment fund. If the Secretary of Labor determines that any State action results in the paying of such interest directly or indirectly (by an equivalent reduction in State unemployment taxes or otherwise) from such unemployment fund, the Secretary of Labor shall not certify such State\u2019s unemployment compensation law under section 3304 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Such noncertification shall be made in accordance with section 3304(c) of such Code.\n  (6)\n    (A) For purposes of paragraph (2), any voluntary repayment shall be applied against advances made under section 1321 of this title on the last made first repaid basis. Any other repayment of such an advance shall be applied against advances on a first made first repaid basis.\n    (B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term \u201cvoluntary repayment\u201d means any repayment made under subsection (a).\n  (7) This subsection shall only apply to advances made on or after April 1, 1982.\n  (8)\n    (A) With respect to interest due under this section on September 30 of 1983, 1984, or 1985 (other than interest previously deferred under paragraph (3)(C)), a State may pay 80 percent of such interest in four annual installments of at least 20 percent beginning with the year after the year in which it is otherwise due, if such State meets the criteria of subparagraph (B). No interest shall accrue on such deferred interest.\n    (B) To meet the criteria of this subparagraph a State must\u2014\n      (i) have taken no action since October 1, 1982, which would reduce its net unemployment tax effort or the net solvency of its unemployment system (as determined for purposes of section 3302(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986); and\n      (ii)\n        (I) have taken an action (as certified by the Secretary of Labor) after March 31, 1982, which would have increased revenue liabilities and decreased benefits under the State\u2019s unemployment compensation system (hereinafter referred to as a \u201csolvency effort\u201d) by a combined total of the applicable percentage (as compared to such revenues and benefits as would have been in effect without such State action) for the calendar year for which the deferral is requested; or\n        (II) have had, for taxable year 1982, an average unemployment tax rate which was equal to or greater than 2.0 percent of the total of the wages (as determined without any limitation on amount) attributable to such State subject to contribution under the State unemployment compensation law with respect to such taxable year.\n    In the case of the first year for which there is a deferral (over a 4-year period) of the interest otherwise payable for such year, the applicable percentage shall be 25 percent. In the case of the second such year, the applicable percentage shall be 35 percent. In the case of the third such year, the applicable percentage shall be 50 percent.\n    (C)\n      (i) The base year is the first year for which deferral under this provision is requested and subsequently granted. The Secretary of Labor shall estimate the unemployment rate for the base year. To determine whether a State meets the requirements of subparagraph (B)(ii)(I), the Secretary of Labor shall determine the percentage by which the benefits and taxes in the base year with the application of the action referred to in subparagraph (B)(ii)(I) are lower or greater, as the case may be, than such benefits and taxes would have been without the application of such action. In making this determination, the Secretary shall deem the application of the action referred to in subparagraph (B)(ii)(I) to have been effective for the base year to the same extent as such action is effective for the year following the year for which the deferral is sought.

State flexibility in individual market reforms.\n(a) Waiver of requirements where implementation of acceptable alternative mechanism.\n  (1) In general. The requirements of section 300gg\u201341 of this title shall not apply with respect to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in the State so long as a State is found to be implementing, in accordance with this section and consistent with section 300gg\u201362(b) of this title, an alternative mechanism (in this section referred to as an \u201cacceptable alternative mechanism\u201d)\u2014\n    (A) under which all eligible individuals are provided a choice of health insurance coverage;\n    (B) under which such coverage does not impose any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to such coverage;\n    (C) under which such choice of coverage includes at least one policy form of coverage that is comparable to comprehensive health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in such State or that is comparable to a standard option of coverage available under the group or individual health insurance laws of such State; and\n    (D) in a State which is implementing\u2014\n      (i) a model act described in subsection (c)(1),\n      (ii) a qualified high risk pool described in subsection (c)(2), or\n      (iii) a mechanism described in subsection (c)(3).\n  (2) Permissible forms of mechanisms. A private or public individual health insurance mechanism (such as a health insurance coverage pool or programs, mandatory group conversion policies, guaranteed issue of one or more plans of individual health insurance coverage, or open enrollment by one or more health insurance issuers), or combination of such mechanisms, that is designed to provide access to health benefits for individuals in the individual market in the State in accordance with this section may constitute an acceptable alternative mechanism.\n(b) Application of acceptable alternative mechanisms.\n  (1) Presumption.\n    (A) In general. Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, a State is presumed to be implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism in accordance with this section as of July 1, 1997, if, by not later than April 1, 1997, the chief executive officer of a State\u2014\n      (i) notifies the Secretary that the State has enacted or intends to enact (by not later than January 1, 1998, or July 1, 1998, in the case of a State described in subparagraph (B)(ii)) any necessary legislation to provide for the implementation of a mechanism reasonably designed to be an acceptable alternative mechanism as of January 1, 1998, (or, in the case of a State described in subparagraph (B)(ii), July 1, 1998); and\n      (ii) provides the Secretary with such information as the Secretary may require to review the mechanism and its implementation (or proposed implementation) under this subsection.\n    (B) Delay permitted for certain States.\n      (i) Effect of delay. In the case of a State described in clause (ii) that provides notice under subparagraph (A)(i), for the presumption to continue on and after July 1, 1998, the chief executive officer of the State by April 1, 1998\u2014\n        (I) must notify the Secretary that the State has enacted any necessary legislation to provide for the implementation of a mechanism reasonably designed to be an acceptable alternative mechanism as of July 1, 1998; and\n        (II) must provide the Secretary with such information as the Secretary may require to review the mechanism and its implementation (or proposed implementation) under this subsection.\n      (ii) States described. A State described in this clause is a State that has a legislature that does not meet within the 12-month period beginning on August 21, 1996.\n    (C) Continued application. In order for a mechanism to continue to be presumed to be an acceptable alternative mechanism, the State shall provide the Secretary every 3 years with information described in subparagraph (A)(ii) or (B)(i)(II) (as the case may be).\n  (2) Notice. If the Secretary finds, after review of information provided under paragraph (1) and in consultation with the chief executive officer of the State and the insurance commissioner or chief insurance regulatory official of the State, that such a mechanism is not an acceptable alternative mechanism or is not (or no longer) being implemented, the Secretary\u2014\n    (A) shall notify the State of\u2014\n      (i) such preliminary determination, and\n      (ii) the consequences under paragraph (3) of a failure to implement such a mechanism; and\n    (B) shall permit the State a reasonable opportunity in which to modify the mechanism (or to adopt another mechanism) in a manner so that may be an acceptable alternative mechanism or to provide for implementation of such a mechanism.\n  (3) Final determination. If, after providing notice and opportunity under paragraph (2), the Secretary finds that the mechanism is not an acceptable alternative mechanism or the State is not implementing such a mechanism, the Secretary shall notify the State that the State is no longer considered to be implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism and that the requirements of section 300gg\u201341 of this title shall apply to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in the State, effective as of a date specified in the notice.\n  (4) Limitation on secretarial authority. The Secretary shall not make a determination under paragraph (2) or (3) on any basis other than the basis that a mechanism is not an acceptable alternative mechanism or is not being implemented.\n  (5) Future adoption of mechanisms. If a State, after January 1, 1997, submits the notice and information described in paragraph (1), unless the Secretary makes a finding described in paragraph (3) within the 90-day period beginning on the date of submission of the notice and information, the mechanism shall be considered to be an acceptable alternative mechanism for purposes of this section, effective 90 days after the end of such period, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (1).\n(c) Provision related to risk.\n  (1) Adoption of NAIC models. The model act referred to in subsection (a)(1)(D)(i) is the Small Employer and Individual Health Insurance Availability Model Act (adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on June 3, 1996) insofar as it applies to individual health insurance coverage or the Individual Health Insurance Portability Model Act (also adopted by such Association on such date).\n  (2) Qualified high risk pool. For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(D)(ii), a \u201cqualified high risk pool\u201d described in this paragraph is a high risk pool that\u2014\n    (A) provides to all eligible individuals health insurance coverage (or comparable coverage) that does not impose any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to such coverage for all eligible individuals, and\n    (B) provides for premium rates and covered benefits for such coverage consistent with standards included in the NAIC Model Health Plan for Uninsurable Individuals Act (as in effect as of August 21, 1996).\n  (3) Other mechanisms. For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(D)(iii), a mechanism described in this paragraph\u2014\n    (A) provides for risk adjustment, risk spreading, or a risk spreading mechanism (among issuers or policies of an issuer) or otherwise provides for some financial subsidization for eligible individuals, including through assistance to participating issuers; or\n    (B) is a mechanism under which each eligible individual is provided a choice of all individual health insurance coverage otherwise available.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above of the text \"any legislative provision increasing direct costs of a Federal intergovernmental mandate contained in any amendments in disagreement between the two Houses to any bill or resolution reported by the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate or House of Representatives.\"?

The Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives shall consult with the committees of its House having legislative jurisdiction during the preparation, consideration, and enforcement of the concurrent resolution on the budget with respect to all matters which relate to the jurisdiction or functions of such committees.\n(i) Social security point of order. It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget (or amendment, motion, or conference report on the resolution) that would decrease the excess of social security revenues over social security outlays in any of the fiscal years covered by the concurrent resolution. No change in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.] shall be treated as affecting the amount of social security revenues unless such provision changes the income tax treatment of social security benefits.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above of the text \"the surplus or deficit in the budget;\"?

The Secretary shall establish a program, to be known as the Forest Legacy Program, in cooperation with appropriate State, regional, and other units of government for the purposes of ascertaining and protecting environmentally important forest areas that are threatened by conversion to nonforest uses and, through the use of conservation easements and other mechanisms, for promoting forest land protection and other conservation opportunities. Such purposes shall also include the protection of important scenic, cultural, fish, wildlife, and recreational resources, riparian areas, and other ecological values.\n(b) State and regional forest legacy programs. The Secretary shall exercise the authority under subsection (a) in conjunction with State or regional programs that the Secretary deems consistent with this section.\n(c) Interests in land. In addition to the authorities granted under section 515 of this title and section 2268a(a) of title 7, the Secretary may acquire from willing landowners lands and interests therein, including conservation easements and rights of public access, for Forest Legacy Program purposes. The Secretary shall not acquire conservation easements with title held in common ownership with any other entity.\n(d) Implementation.\n  (1) In general. Lands and interests therein acquired under subsection (c) may be held in perpetuity for program and easement administration purposes as the Secretary may provide. In administering lands and interests therein under the program, the Secretary shall identify the environmental values to be protected by entry of the lands into the program, management activities which are planned and the manner in which they may affect the values identified, and obtain from the landowner other information determined appropriate for administration and management purposes.\n  (2) Initial programs. Not later than November 28, 1991, the Secretary shall establish a regional program in furtherance of the Northern Forest Lands Study in the States of New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine under Public Law 100\u2013446. The Secretary shall establish additional programs in each of the Northeast, Midwest, South, and Western regions of the United States, and the Pacific Northwest (including the State of Washington), on the preparation of an assessment of the need for such programs.\n(e) Eligibility. Not later than November 28, 1991, and in consultation with State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committees established under section 2113(b) of this title and similar regional organizations, the Secretary shall establish eligibility criteria for the designation of forest areas from which lands may be entered into the Forest Legacy Program and subsequently select such appropriate areas. To be eligible, such areas shall have significant environmental values or shall be threatened by present or future conversion to nonforest uses. Of land proposed to be included in the Forest Legacy Program, the Secretary shall give priority to lands which can be effectively protected and managed, and which have important scenic or recreational values; riparian areas; fish and wildlife values, including threatened and endangered species; or other ecological values.\n(f) Application. For areas included in the Forest Legacy Program, an owner of lands or interests in lands who wishes to participate may prepare and submit an application at such time in such form and containing such information as the Secretary may prescribe. The Secretary shall give reasonable advance notice for the submission of all applications to the State forester, equivalent State official, or other appropriate State or regional natural resource management agency. If applications exceed the ability of the Secretary to fund them, priority shall be given to those forest areas having the greatest need for protection pursuant to the criteria described in subsection (e).\n(g) State consent. Where a State has not approved the acquisition of land under section 515 of this title, the Secretary shall not acquire lands or interests therein under authority granted by this section outside an area of that State designated as a part of a program established under subsection (b).\n(h) Forest management activities.\n  (1) In general. Conservation easements or deed reservations acquired or reserved pursuant to this section may allow forest management activities, including timber management, on areas entered in the Forest Legacy Program insofar as the Secretary deems such activities consistent with the purposes of this section.\n  (2) Assignment of responsibilities. For Forest Legacy Program areas, the Secretary may delegate or assign management and enforcement responsibilities over federally owned lands and interests in lands only to another governmental entity.\n(i) Duties of owners. Under the terms of a conservation easement or other property interest acquired under subsection (b), the landowner shall be required to manage property in a manner that is consistent with the purposes for which the land was entered in the Forest Legacy Program and shall not convert such property to other uses. Hunting, fishing, hiking, and similar recreational uses shall not be considered inconsistent with the purposes of this program.\n(j) Compensation and cost sharing.\n  (1) Compensation. The Secretary shall pay the fair market value of any property interest acquired under this section. Payments under this section shall be in accordance with Federal appraisal and acquisition standards and procedures.\n  (2) Cost sharing. In accordance with terms and conditions that the Secretary shall prescribe, costs for the acquisition of lands or interests therein or project costs shall be shared among participating entities including regional organizations, State and other governmental units, landowners, corporations, or private organizations. Such costs may include, but are not limited to, those associated with planning, administration, property acquisition, and property management. To the extent practicable, the Federal share of total program costs shall not exceed 75 percent, including any in-kind contribution.\n(k) Easements.\n  (1) Reserved interest deeds. As used in this section, the term \u201cconservation easement\u201d includes an easement utilizing a reserved interest deed where the grantee acquires all rights, title, and interests in a property, except those rights, title, and interests that may run with the land that are expressly reserved by a grantor.\n  (2) Prohibitions on limitations. Notwithstanding any provision of State law, no conservation easement held by the United States or its successors or assigns under this section shall be limited in duration or scope or be defeasible by\u2014\n    (A) the conservation easement being in gross or appurtenant;\n    (B) the management of the conservation easement having been delegated or assigned to a non-Federal entity;\n    (C) any requirement under State law for re-recordation or renewal of the easement; or\n    (D) any future disestablishment of a Forest Legacy Program area or other Federal project for which the conservation easement was originally acquired.\n  (3) Construction. Notwithstanding any provision of State law, conservation easements shall be construed to effect the Federal purposes for which they were acquired and, in interpreting their terms, there shall be no presumption favoring the conservation easement holder or fee owner.\n(l) Optional State grants.\n  (1) In general. The Secretary shall, at the request of a participating State, provide a grant to the State to carry out the Forest Legacy Program in the State.\n  (2) Administration. If a State elects to receive a grant under this subsection\u2014\n    (A) the Secretary shall use a portion of the funds made available under subsection (m), as determined by the Secretary, to provide a grant to the State; and\n    (B) the State shall use the grant to carry out the Forest Legacy Program in the State, including the acquisition by the State of lands and interests in lands.\n  (3) Transfer of Forest Legacy Program land\u2014\n    (A) In general.

In conveying land or an interest in land under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may require that\u2014\n      (i) the deed conveying the land or interest in land include requirements for the management of the land in a manner that\u2014\n        (I) conserves the land or interest in land; and\n        (II) is consistent with any other Forest Legacy Program purposes for which the land or interest in land was acquired;\n      (ii) if the land or interest in land is subsequently sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of by the State of Vermont, the State shall\u2014\n        (I) reimburse the Secretary in an amount that is based on the current market value of the land or interest in land in proportion to the amount of consideration paid by the United States for the land or interest in land; or\n        (II) convey to the Secretary land or an interest in land that is equal in value to the land or interest in land conveyed.\n    (C) Disposition of funds. Amounts received by the Secretary under subparagraph (B)(ii) shall be credited to the Wildland Fire Management account, to remain available until expended.\n(m) Appropriation.

{"id": "test4k_usc_t2c_68", "task": "text2cite", "texttype": "uscode", "prompt": "\u00a7 4722. Aquatic nuisance species program.\n(a) In general. The Task Force shall develop and implement a program for waters of the United States to prevent introduction and dispersal of aquatic nuisance species; to monitor, control and study such species; and to disseminate related information.\n(b) Content. The program developed under subsection (a) shall\u2014\n  (1) identify the goals, priorities, and approaches for aquatic nuisance species prevention, monitoring, control, education and research to be conducted or funded by the Federal Government;\n  (2) describe the specific prevention, monitoring, control, education and research activities to be conducted by each Task Force member;\n  (3) coordinate aquatic nuisance species programs and activities of Task Force members and affected State agencies;\n  (4) describe the role of each Task Force member in implementing the elements of the program as set forth in this subchapter;\n  (5) include recommendations for funding to implement elements of the program; and\n  (6) develop a demonstration program of prevention, monitoring, control, education and research for the zebra mussel, to be implemented in the Great Lakes and any other waters infested, or likely to become infested in the near future, by the zebra mussel.\n(c) Prevention.\n  (1) In general. The Task Force shall establish and implement measures, within the program developed under subsection (a), to minimize the risk of introduction of aquatic nuisance species to waters of the United States, including\u2014\n    (A) identification of pathways by which aquatic organisms are introduced to waters of the United States;\n    (B) assessment of the risk that an aquatic organism carried by an identified pathway may become an aquatic nuisance species; and\n    (C) evaluation of whether measures to prevent introductions of aquatic nuisance species are effective and environmentally sound.\n  (2) Implementation. Whenever the Task Force determines that there is a substantial risk of unintentional introduction of an aquatic nuisance species by an identified pathway and that the adverse consequences of such an introduction are likely to be substantial, the Task Force shall, acting through the appropriate Federal agency, and after an opportunity for public comment, carry out cooperative, environmentally sound efforts with regional, State and local entities to minimize the risk of such an introduction.\n(d) Monitoring. The Task Force shall establish and implement monitoring measures, within the program developed under subsection (a), to\u2014\n  (1) detect unintentional introductions of aquatic nuisance species;\n  (2) determine the dispersal of aquatic nuisance species after introduction; and\n  (3) provide for the early detection and prevention of infestations of aquatic nuisance species in unaffected drainage basins.\n(e) Control.\n  (1) In general. The Task Force may develop cooperative efforts, within the program established under subsection (a), to control established aquatic nuisance species to minimize the risk of harm to the environment and the public health and welfare. For purposes of this chapter, control efforts include eradication of infestations, reductions of populations, development of means of adapting human activities and public facilities to accommodate infestations, and prevention of the spread of aquatic nuisance species from infested areas. Such control efforts shall be developed in consultation with affected Federal agencies, States, Indian Tribes, local governments, interjurisdictional organizations, and other appropriate entities. Control actions authorized by this section shall be based on the best available scientific information and shall be conducted in an environmentally sound manner.\n  (2) Decisions. The Task Force or any other affected agency or entity may recommend that the Task Force initiate a control effort. In determining whether a control program is warranted, the Task Force shall evaluate the need for control (including the projected consequences of no control and less than full control); the technical and biological feasibility and cost-effectiveness of alternative control strategies and actions; whether the benefits of control, including costs avoided, exceed the costs of the program; the risk of harm to non-target organisms and ecosystems, public health and welfare; and such other considerations the Task Force determines appropriate. The Task Force shall also determine the nature and extent of control of target aquatic nuisance species that is feasible and desirable.\n  (3) Programs. If the Task Force determines in accordance with paragraph (2) that control of an aquatic nuisance species is warranted, the Task Force shall develop a proposed control program to achieve the target level of control. A notice summarizing the proposed action and soliciting comments shall be published in the Federal Register, in major newspapers in the region affected, and in principal trade publications of the industries affected. Within 180 days of proposing a control program, and after consultation with affected governmental and other appropriate entities and taking into consideration other comments received, the Task Force shall complete development of the proposed control program.\n(f) Research.\n  (1) Priorities. The Task Force shall, within the program developed under subsection (a), conduct research concerning\u2014\n    (A) the environmental and economic risks and impacts associated with the introduction of aquatic nuisance species into the waters of the United States;\n    (B) the principal pathways by which aquatic nuisance species are introduced and dispersed;\n    (C) possible methods for the prevention, monitoring and control of aquatic nuisance species; and\n    (D) the assessment of the effectiveness of prevention, monitoring and control methods.\n  (2) Protocol. Within 90 days of November 29, 1990, the Task Force shall establish and follow a protocol to ensure that research activities carried out under this subchapter do not result in the introduction of aquatic nuisance species to waters of the United States.\n  (3) Grants for research. The Task Force shall allocate funds authorized under this chapter for competitive research grants to study all aspects of aquatic nuisance species, which shall be administered through the National Sea Grant College Program and the Cooperative Fishery and Wildlife Research Units. Grants shall be conditioned to ensure that any recipient of funds follows the protocol established under paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n(g) Technical assistance. The Task Force shall, within the program developed under subsection (a), provide technical assistance to State and local governments and persons to minimize the environmental, public health, and safety risks associated with aquatic nuisance species, including an early warning system for advance notice of possible infestations and appropriate responses.\n(h) Education. The Task Force shall, with the program developed under subsection (a), establish and implement educational programs through Sea Grant Marine Advisory Services and any other available resources that it determines to be appropriate to inform the general public, State governments, governments of political subdivisions of States, and industrial and recreational users of aquatic resources in connection with matters concerning the identification of aquatic nuisance species, and control methods for such species, including the prevention of the further distribution of such species.\n(i) Zebra mussel demonstration program.\n  (1) Zebra mussel.\n    (A) In general. The Task Force shall, within the program developed under subsection (a), undertake a program of prevention, monitoring, control, education and research for the zebra mussel to be implemented in the Great Lakes and any other waters of the United States infested or likely to become infested by the zebra mussel, including\u2014\n      (i) research and development concerning the species life history, environmental tolerances and impacts on fisheries and other ecosystem components, and the efficacy of control mechanisms and means of avoiding or minimizing impacts;\n      (ii) tracking the dispersal of the species and establishment of an early warning system to alert likely areas of future infestations;\n      (iii) development of control plans in coordination with regional, State and local entities; and\n      (iv) provision of technical assistance to regional, State and local entities to carry out this section.\n    (B) Public facility research and development. The Assistant Secretary, in consultation with the Task Force, shall develop a program of research, technology development, and demonstration for the environmentally sound control of zebra mussels in and around public facilities. The Assistant Secretary shall collect and make available, through publications and other appropriate means, information pertaining to such control methods.\n    (C) Voluntary guidelines. Not later than 1 year after October 26, 1996, the Task Force shall develop and submit to the Secretary voluntary guidelines for controlling the spread of the zebra mussel and, if appropriate, other aquatic nuisance species through recreational activities, including boating and fishing. Not later than 4 months after the date of such submission, and after providing notice and an opportunity for public comment, the Secretary shall issue voluntary guidelines that are based on the guidelines developed by the Task Force under this subparagraph.\n  (2) Dispersal containment analysis.\n    (A) Research. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in cooperation with the National Science Foundation and the Task Force, shall provide research grants on a competitive basis for projects that\u2014\n      (i) identify environmentally sound methods for controlling the dispersal of aquatic nuisance species, such as the zebra mussel; and\n      (ii) adhere to research protocols developed pursuant to subsection (f)(2).\n    (B) Authorization of appropriations.

Each telecommunications carrier has the duty\u2014\n  (1) to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers; and\n  (2) not to install network features, functions, or capabilities that do not comply with the guidelines and standards established pursuant to section 255 or 256 of this title.\n(b) Obligations of all local exchange carriers. Each local exchange carrier has the following duties:\n  (1) Resale. The duty not to prohibit, and not to impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on, the resale of its telecommunications services.\n  (2) Number portability. The duty to provide, to the extent technically feasible, number portability in accordance with requirements prescribed by the Commission.\n  (3) Dialing parity. The duty to provide dialing parity to competing providers of telephone exchange service and telephone toll service, and the duty to permit all such providers to have nondiscriminatory access to telephone numbers, operator services, directory assistance, and directory listing, with no unreasonable dialing delays.\n  (4) Access to rights-of-way. The duty to afford access to the poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way of such carrier to competing providers of telecommunications services on rates, terms, and conditions that are consistent with section 224 of this title.\n  (5) Reciprocal compensation. The duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.\n(c) Additional obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers. In addition to the duties contained in subsection (b), each incumbent local exchange carrier has the following duties:\n  (1) Duty to negotiate. The duty to negotiate in good faith in accordance with section 252 of this title the particular terms and conditions of agreements to fulfill the duties described in paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (b) and this subsection. The requesting telecommunications carrier also has the duty to negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of such agreements.\n  (2) Interconnection. The duty to provide, for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier, interconnection with the local exchange carrier\u2019s network\u2014\n    (A) for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access;\n    (B) at any technically feasible point within the carrier\u2019s network;\n    (C) that is at least equal in quality to that provided by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any subsidiary, affiliate, or any other party to which the carrier provides interconnection; and\n    (D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252 of this title.\n  (3) Unbundled access. The duty to provide, to any requesting telecommunications carrier for the provision of a telecommunications service, nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252 of this title. An incumbent local exchange carrier shall provide such unbundled network elements in a manner that allows requesting carriers to combine such elements in order to provide such telecommunications service.\n  (4) Resale. The duty\u2014\n    (A) to offer for resale at wholesale rates any telecommunications service that the carrier provides at retail to subscribers who are not telecommunications carriers; and\n    (B) not to prohibit, and not to impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on, the resale of such telecommunications service, except that a State commission may, consistent with regulations prescribed by the Commission under this section, prohibit a reseller that obtains at wholesale rates a telecommunications service that is available at retail only to a category of subscribers from offering such service to a different category of subscribers.\n  (5) Notice of changes. The duty to provide reasonable public notice of changes in the information necessary for the transmission and routing of services using that local exchange carrier\u2019s facilities or networks, as well as of any other changes that would affect the interoperability of those facilities and networks.\n  (6) Collocation. The duty to provide, on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, for physical collocation of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at the premises of the local exchange carrier, except that the carrier may provide for virtual collocation if the local exchange carrier demonstrates to the State commission that physical collocation is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations.\n(d) Implementation.\n  (1) In general. Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall complete all actions necessary to establish regulations to implement the requirements of this section.\n  (2) Access standards. In determining what network elements should be made available for purposes of subsection (c)(3), the Commission shall consider, at a minimum, whether\u2014\n    (A) access to such network elements as are proprietary in nature is necessary; and\n    (B) the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide the services that it seeks to offer.\n  (3) Preservation of State access regulations. In prescribing and enforcing regulations to implement the requirements of this section, the Commission shall not preclude the enforcement of any regulation, order, or policy of a State commission that\u2014\n    (A) establishes access and interconnection obligations of local exchange carriers;\n    (B) is consistent with the requirements of this section; and\n    (C) does not substantially prevent implementation of the requirements of this section and the purposes of this part.\n(e) Numbering administration.\n  (1) Commission authority and jurisdiction. The Commission shall create or designate one or more impartial entities to administer telecommunications numbering and to make such numbers available on an equitable basis. The Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction over those portions of the North American Numbering Plan that pertain to the United States. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Commission from delegating to State commissions or other entities all or any portion of such jurisdiction.\n  (2) Costs. The cost of establishing telecommunications numbering administration arrangements and number portability shall be borne by all telecommunications carriers on a competitively neutral basis as determined by the Commission.\n  (3) Universal emergency telephone number. The Commission and any agency or entity to which the Commission has delegated authority under this subsection shall designate 9\u20131\u20131 as the universal emergency telephone number within the United States for reporting an emergency to appropriate authorities and requesting assistance. The designation shall apply to both wireline and wireless telephone service. In making the designation, the Commission (and any such agency or entity) shall provide appropriate transition periods for areas in which 9\u20131\u20131 is not in use as an emergency telephone number on October 26, 1999.\n  (4) Universal telephone number for national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system. 9\u20138\u20138 is designated as the universal telephone number within the United States for the purpose of the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system operating through the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline maintained by the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use under section 520E\u20133 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb\u201336c) and through the Veterans Crisis Line maintained by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under section 1720F(h) of title 38.\n(f) Exemptions, suspensions, and modifications.\n  (1) Exemption for certain rural telephone companies.\n    (A) Exemption. Subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to a rural telephone company until (i) such company has received a bona fide request for interconnection, services, or network elements, and (ii) the State commission determines (under subparagraph (B)) that such request is not unduly economically burdensome, is technically feasible, and is consistent with section 254 of this title (other than subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)(D) thereof).\n    (B) State termination of exemption and implementation schedule. The party making a bona fide request of a rural telephone company for interconnection, services, or network elements shall submit a notice of its request to the State commission. The State commission shall conduct an inquiry for the purpose of determining whether to terminate the exemption under subparagraph (A). Within 120 days after the State commission receives notice of the request, the State commission shall terminate the exemption if the request is not unduly economically burdensome, is technically feasible, and is consistent with section 254 of this title (other than subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)(D) thereof). Upon termination of the exemption, a State commission shall establish an implementation schedule for compliance with the request that is consistent in time and manner with Commission regulations.\n    (C) Limitation on exemption. The exemption provided by this paragraph shall not apply with respect to a request under subsection (c) from a cable operator providing video programming, and seeking to provide any telecommunications service, in the area in which the rural telephone company provides video programming. The limitation contained in this subparagraph shall not apply to a rural telephone company that is providing video programming on February 8, 1996.\n  (2) Suspensions and modifications for rural carriers. A local exchange carrier with fewer than 2 percent of the Nation\u2019s subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide may petition a State commission for a suspension or modification of the application of a requirement or requirements of subsection (b) or (c) to telephone exchange service facilities specified in such petition. The State commission shall grant such petition to the extent that, and for such duration as, the State commission determines that such suspension or modification\u2014\n    (A) is necessary\u2014\n      (i) to avoid a significant adverse economic impact on users of telecommunications services generally;\n      (ii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is unduly economically burdensome; or\n      (iii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is technically infeasible; and\n    (B) is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\n  The State commission shall act upon any petition filed under this paragraph within 180 days after receiving such petition. Pending such action, the State commission may suspend enforcement of the requirement or requirements to which the petition applies with respect to the petitioning carrier or carriers.\n(g) Continued enforcement of exchange access and interconnection requirements. On and after February 8, 1996, each local exchange carrier, to the extent that it provides wireline services, shall provide exchange access, information access, and exchange services for such access to interexchange carriers and information service providers in accordance with the same equal access and nondiscriminatory interconnection restrictions and obligations (including receipt of compensation) that apply to such carrier on the date immediately preceding February 8, 1996, under any court order, consent decree, or regulation, order, or policy of the Commission, until such restrictions and obligations are explicitly superseded by regulations prescribed by the Commission after February 8, 1996. During the period beginning on February 8, 1996, and until such restrictions and obligations are so superseded, such restrictions and obligations shall be enforceable in the same manner as regulations of the Commission.\n(h) \u201cIncumbent local exchange carrier\u201d defined.\n  (1) Definition. For purposes of this section, the term \u201cincumbent local exchange carrier\u201d means, with respect to an area, the local exchange carrier that\u2014\n    (A) on February 8, 1996, provided telephone exchange service in such area; and\n    (B)\n      (i) on February 8, 1996, was deemed to be a member of the exchange carrier association pursuant to section 69.601(b) of the Commission\u2019s regulations (47 C.F.R. 69.601(b)); or\n      (ii) is a person or entity that, on or after February 8, 1996, became a successor or assign of a member described in clause (i).\n  (2) Treatment of comparable carriers as incumbents. The Commission may, by rule, provide for the treatment of a local exchange carrier (or class or category thereof) as an incumbent local exchange carrier for purposes of this section if\u2014\n    (A) such carrier occupies a position in the market for telephone exchange service within an area that is comparable to the position occupied by a carrier described in paragraph (1);\n    (B) such carrier has substantially replaced an incumbent local exchange carrier described in paragraph (1); and\n    (C) such treatment is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity and the purposes of this section.\n(i) Savings provision. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the Commission\u2019s authority under section 201 of this title.\n\nWhat is the exact citation above of the text \"to avoid a significant adverse economic impact on users of telecommunications services generally;\"?

In enacting section 2151a(b)(3) of this title the Congress recognized the importance of forests and tree cover to the developing countries. The Congress is particularly concerned about the continuing and accelerating alteration, destruction, and loss of tropical forests in developing countries, which pose a serious threat to development and the environment. Tropical forest destruction and loss\u2014\n  (1) result in shortages of wood, especially wood for fuel; loss of biologically productive wetlands; siltation of lakes, reservoirs, and irrigation systems; floods; destruction of indigenous peoples; extinction of plant and animal species; reduced capacity for food production; and loss of genetic resources; and\n  (2) can result in desertification and destabilization of the earth\u2019s climate.\nProperly managed tropical forests provide a sustained flow of resources essential to the economic growth of developing countries, as well as genetic resources of value to developed and developing countries alike.\n(b) Priorities. The concerns expressed in subsection (a) and the recommendations of the United States Interagency Task Force on Tropical Forests shall be given high priority by the President\u2014\n  (1) in formulating and carrying out programs and policies with respect to developing countries, including those relating to bilateral and multilateral assistance and those relating to private sector activities; and\n  (2) in seeking opportunities to coordinate public and private development and investment activities which affect forests in developing countries.\n(c) Assistance to developing countries. In providing assistance to developing countries, the President shall do the following:\n  (1) Place a high priority on conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests.\n  (2) To the fullest extent feasible, engage in dialogues and exchanges of information with recipient countries\u2014\n    (A) which stress the importance of conserving and sustainably managing forest resources for the long-term economic benefit of those countries, as well as the irreversible losses associated with forest destruction, and\n    (B) which identify and focus on policies of those countries which directly or indirectly contribute to deforestation.\n  (3) To the fullest extent feasible, support projects and activities\u2014\n    (A) which offer employment and income alternatives to those who otherwise would cause destruction and loss of forests, and\n    (B) which help developing countries identify and implement alternatives to colonizing forested areas.\n  (4) To the fullest extent feasible, support training programs, educational efforts, and the establishment or strengthening of institutions which increase the capacity of developing countries to formulate forest policies, engage in relevant land-use planning, and otherwise improve the management of their forests.\n  (5) To the fullest extent feasible, help end destructive slash-and-burn agriculture by supporting stable and productive farming practices in areas already cleared or degraded and on lands which inevitably will be settled, with special emphasis on demonstrating the feasibility of agroforestry and other techniques which use technologies and methods suited to the local environment and traditional agricultural techniques and feature close consultation with and involvement of local people.\n  (6) To the fullest extent feasible, help conserve forests which have not yet been degraded, by helping to increase production on lands already cleared or degraded through support of reforestation, fuelwood, and other sustainable forestry projects and practices, making sure that local people are involved at all stages of project design and implementation.\n  (7) To the fullest extent feasible, support projects and other activities to conserve forested watersheds and rehabilitate those which have been deforested, making sure that local people are involved at all stages of project design and implementation.\n  (8) To the fullest extent feasible, support training, research, and other actions which lead to sustainable and more environmentally sound practices for timber harvesting, removal, and processing, including reforestation, soil conservation, and other activities to rehabilitate degraded forest lands.\n  (9) To the fullest extent feasible, support research to expand knowledge of tropical forests and identify alternatives which will prevent forest destruction, loss, or degradation, including research in agroforestry, sustainable management of natural forests, small-scale farms and gardens, small-scale animal husbandry, wider application of adopted traditional practices, and suitable crops and crop combinations.\n  (10) To the fullest extent feasible, conserve biological diversity in forest areas by\u2014\n    (A) supporting and cooperating with United States Government agencies, other donors (both bilateral and multilateral), and other appropriate governmental, intergovernmental, and nongovernmental organizations in efforts to identify, establish, and maintain a representative network of protected tropical forest ecosystems on a worldwide basis;\n    (B) whenever appropriate, making the establishment of protected areas a condition of support for activities involving forest clearance or degradation; and\n    (C) helping developing countries identify tropical forest ecosystems and species in need of protection and establish and maintain appropriate protected areas.\n  (11) To the fullest extent feasible, engage in efforts to increase the awareness of United States Government agencies and other donors, both bilateral and multilateral, of the immediate and long-term value of tropical forests.\n  (12) To the fullest extent feasible, utilize the resources and abilities of all relevant United States Government agencies.\n  (13) Require that any program or project under this part significantly affecting tropical forests (including projects involving the planting of exotic plant species)\u2014\n    (A) be based upon careful analysis of the alternatives available to achieve the best sustainable use of the land, and\n    (B) take full account of the environmental impacts of the proposed activities on biological diversity,\n  as provided for in the environmental procedures of the Agency for International Development.\n  (14) Deny assistance under this part for\u2014\n    (A) the procurement or use of logging equipment, unless an environmental assessment indicates that all timber harvesting operations involved will be conducted in an environmentally sound manner which minimizes forest destruction and that the proposed activity will produce positive economic benefits and sustainable forest management systems; and\n    (B) actions which significantly degrade national parks or similar protected areas which contain tropical forests or introduce exotic plants or animals into such areas.\n  (15) Deny assistance under this part for the following activities unless an environmental assessment indicates that the proposed activity will contribute significantly and directly to improving the livelihood of the rural poor and will be conducted in an environmentally sound manner which supports sustainable development:\n    (A) Activities which would result in the conversion of forest lands to the rearing of livestock.\n    (B) The construction, upgrading, or maintenance of roads (including temporary haul roads for logging or other extractive industries) which pass through relatively undegraded forest lands.\n    (C) The colonization of forest lands.\n    (D) The construction of dams or other water control structures which flood relatively undegraded forest lands.\n(d) PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations. Whenever feasible, the President shall accomplish the objectives of this section through projects managed by private and voluntary organizations or international, regional, or national nongovernmental organizations which are active in the region or country where the project is located.\n(e) Country analysis requirements. Each country development strategy statement or other country plan prepared by the Agency for International Development shall include an analysis of\u2014\n  (1) the actions necessary in that country to achieve conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests, and\n  (2) the extent to which the actions proposed for support by the Agency meet the needs thus identified.\n(f) Annual report. Each annual report required by section 2394(a) of this title shall include a report on the implementation of this section.\n\n\u00a7 416.

For purposes of this part\u2014\n  (1) Attribution to United States persons. This subsection\u2014\n    (A) shall apply to the extent that the effect is to treat stock of a passive foreign investment company as owned by a United States person, and\n    (B) except to the extent provided in regulations, shall not apply to treat stock owned (or treated as owned under this subsection) by a United States person as owned by any other person.\n  (2) Corporations.\n    (A) In general. If 50 percent or more in value of the stock of a corporation is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any person, such person shall be considered as owning the stock owned directly or indirectly by or for such corporation in that proportion which the value of the stock which such person so owns bears to the value of all stock in the corporation.\n    (B) 50-percent limitation not to apply to PFIC. For purposes of determining whether a shareholder of a passive foreign investment company is treated as owning stock owned directly or indirectly by or for such company, subparagraph (A) shall be applied without regard to the 50-percent limitation contained therein. Section 1297(d) shall not apply in determining whether a corporation is a passive foreign investment company for purposes of this subparagraph.\n  (3) Partnerships, etc. Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a partnership, estate, or trust shall be considered as being owned proportionately by its partners or beneficiaries.\n  (4) Options. To the extent provided in regulations, if any person has an option to acquire stock, such stock shall be considered as owned by such person. For purposes of this paragraph, an option to acquire such an option, and each one of a series of such options, shall be considered as an option to acquire such stock.\n  (5) Successive application. Stock considered to be owned by a person by reason of the application of paragraph (2), (3), or (4) shall, for purposes of applying such paragraphs, be considered as actually owned by such person.\n(b) Other special rules. For purposes of this part\u2014\n  (1) Time for determination. Stock held by a taxpayer shall be treated as stock in a passive foreign investment company if, at any time during the holding period of the taxpayer with respect to such stock, such corporation (or any predecessor) was a passive foreign investment company which was not a qualified electing fund. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the taxpayer elects to recognize gain (as of the last day of the last taxable year for which the company was a passive foreign investment company (determined without regard to the preceding sentence)) under rules similar to the rules of section 1291(d)(2).\n  (2) Certain corporations not treated as PFIC\u2019s during start-up year. A corporation shall not be treated as a passive foreign investment company for the first taxable year such corporation has gross income (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the \u201cstart-up year\u201d) if\u2014\n    (A) no predecessor of such corporation was a passive foreign investment company,\n    (B) it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such corporation will not be a passive foreign investment company for either of the 1st 2 taxable years following the start-up year, and\n    (C) such corporation is not a passive foreign investment company for either of the 1st 2 taxable years following the start-up year.\n  (3) Certain corporations changing businesses. A corporation shall not be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year if\u2014\n    (A) neither such corporation (nor any predecessor) was a passive foreign investment company for any prior taxable year,\n    (B) it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that\u2014\n      (i) substantially all of the passive income of the corporation for the taxable year is attributable to proceeds from the disposition of 1 or more active trades or businesses, and\n      (ii) such corporation will not be a passive foreign investment company for either of the 1st 2 taxable years following such taxable year, and\n    (C) such corporation is not a passive foreign investment company for either of such 2 taxable years.\n  (4) Separate interests treated as separate corporations. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, where necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, separate classes of stock (or other interests) in a corporation shall be treated as interests in separate corporations.\n  (5) Application of part where stock held by other entity.\n    (A) In general. Under regulations, in any case in which a United States person is treated as owning stock in a passive foreign investment company by reason of subsection (a)\u2014\n      (i) any disposition by the United States person or the person owning such stock which results in the United States person being treated as no longer owning such stock, or\n      (ii) any distribution of property in respect of such stock to the person holding such stock,\n    shall be treated as a disposition by, or distribution to, the United States person with respect to the stock in the passive foreign investment company.\n    (B) Amount treated in same manner as previously taxed income. Rules similar to the rules of section 959(b) shall apply to any amount described in subparagraph (A) and to any amount included in gross income under section 1293(a) (or which would have been so included but for section 951(c)) in respect of stock which the taxpayer is treated as owning under subsection (a).\n  (6) Dispositions. Except as provided in regulations, if a taxpayer uses any stock in a passive foreign investment company as security for a loan, the taxpayer shall be treated as having disposed of such stock.\n  (7) Treatment of certain foreign corporations owning stock in 25-percent owned domestic corporation.\n    (A) In general. If\u2014\n      (i) a foreign corporation is subject to the tax imposed by section 531 (or waives any benefit under any treaty which would otherwise prevent the imposition of such tax), and\n      (ii) such foreign corporation owns at least 25 percent (by value) of the stock of a domestic corporation,\n    for purposes of determining whether such foreign corporation is a passive foreign investment company, any qualified stock held by such domestic corporation shall be treated as an asset which does not produce passive income (and is not held for the production of passive income) and any amount included in gross income with respect to such stock shall not be treated as passive income.\n    (B) Qualified stock. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term \u201cqualified stock\u201d means any stock in a C corporation which is a domestic corporation and which is not a regulated investment company or real estate investment trust.\n  (8) Treatment of certain subpart F inclusions. Any amount included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(B) shall be treated as a distribution received with respect to the stock.\n(c) Treatment of stock held by pooled income fund. If stock in a passive foreign investment company is owned (or treated as owned under subsection (a)) by a pooled income fund (as defined in section 642(c)(5)) and no portion of any gain from a disposition of such stock may be allocated to income under the terms of the governing instrument of such fund\u2014\n  (1) section 1291 shall not apply to any gain on a disposition of such stock by such fund if (without regard to section 1291) a deduction would be allowable with respect to such gain under section 642(c)(3),\n  (2) section 1293 shall not apply with respect to such stock, and\n  (3) in determining whether section 1291 applies to any distribution in respect of such stock, subsection (d) of section 1291 shall not apply.\n(d) Treatment of certain leased property. For purposes of this part\u2014\n  (1) In general. Any tangible personal property with respect to which a foreign corporation is the lessee under a lease with a term of at least 12 months shall be treated as an asset actually held by such corporation.\n  (2) Amount taken into account.\n    (A) In general. The amount taken into account under section 1297(a)(2) with respect to any asset to which paragraph (1) applies shall be the unamortized portion (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of the present value of the payments under the lease for the use of such property.\n    (B) Present value. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the present value of payments described in subparagraph (A) shall be determined in the manner provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary\u2014\n      (i) as of the beginning of the lease term, and\n      (ii) except as provided in such regulations, by using a discount rate equal to the applicable Federal rate determined under section 1274(d)\u2014\n        (I) by substituting the lease term for the term of the debt instrument, and\n        (II) without regard to paragraph (2) or (3) thereof.\n  (3) Exceptions. This subsection shall not apply in any case where\u2014\n    (A) the lessor is a related person (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) with respect to the foreign corporation, or\n    (B) a principal purpose of leasing the property was to avoid the provisions of this part.\n(e) Special rules for certain intangibles. For purposes of this part\u2014\n  (1) Research expenditures. The adjusted basis of the total assets of a controlled foreign corporation shall be increased by the research or experimental expenditures (within the meaning of section 174) paid or incurred by such foreign corporation during the taxable year and the preceding 2 taxable years. Any expenditure otherwise taken into account under the preceding sentence shall be reduced by the amount of any reimbursement received by the controlled foreign corporation with respect to such expenditure.\n  (2) Certain licensed intangibles.\n    (A) In general. In the case of any intangible property (as defined in section 367(d)(4)) with respect to which a controlled foreign corporation is a licensee and which is used by such foreign corporation in the active conduct of a trade or business, the adjusted basis of the total assets of such foreign corporation shall be increased by an amount equal to 300 percent of the payments made during the taxable year by such foreign corporation for the use of such intangible property.\n    (B) Exceptions. Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to\u2014\n      (i) any payments to a foreign person if such foreign person is a related person (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) with respect to the controlled foreign corporation, and\n      (ii) any payments under a license if a principal purpose of entering into such license was to avoid the provisions of this part.\n  (3) Controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of this subsection, the term \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d has the meaning given such term by section 957(a).\n(f) Reporting requirement. Except as otherwise provided by the Secretary, each United States person who is a shareholder of a passive foreign investment company shall file an annual report containing such information as the Secretary may require.\n(g) Regulations.

In addition to any other defenses available by law:\n  (1) No person shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d) solely for providing access or connection to or from a facility, system, or network not under that person\u2019s control, including transmission, downloading, intermediate storage, access software, or other related capabilities that are incidental to providing such access or connection that does not include the creation of the content of the communication.\n  (2) The defenses provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be applicable to a person who is a conspirator with an entity actively involved in the creation or knowing distribution of communications that violate this section, or who knowingly advertises the availability of such communications.\n  (3) The defenses provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be applicable to a person who provides access or connection to a facility, system, or network engaged in the violation of this section that is owned or controlled by such person.\n  (4) No employer shall be held liable under this section for the actions of an employee or agent unless the employee\u2019s or agent\u2019s conduct is within the scope of his or her employment or agency and the employer (A) having knowledge of such conduct, authorizes or ratifies such conduct, or (B) recklessly disregards such conduct.\n  (5) It is a defense to a prosecution under subsection (a)(1)(B) or (d), or under subsection (a)(2) with respect to the use of a facility for an activity under subsection (a)(1)(B) that a person\u2014\n    (A) has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to a communication specified in such subsections, which may involve any appropriate measures to restrict minors from such communications, including any method which is feasible under available technology; or\n    (B) has restricted access to such communication by requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number.\n  (6) The Commission may describe measures which are reasonable, effective, and appropriate to restrict access to prohibited communications under subsection (d). Nothing in this section authorizes the Commission to enforce, or is intended to provide the Commission with the authority to approve, sanction, or permit, the use of such measures. The Commission shall have no enforcement authority over the failure to utilize such measures. The Commission shall not endorse specific products relating to such measures. The use of such measures shall be admitted as evidence of good faith efforts for purposes of paragraph (5) in any action arising under subsection (d). Nothing in this section shall be construed to treat interactive computer services as common carriers or telecommunications carriers.\n(f) Violations of law required; commercial entities, nonprofit libraries, or institutions of higher education.\n  (1) No cause of action may be brought in any court or administrative agency against any person on account of any activity that is not in violation of any law punishable by criminal or civil penalty, and that the person has taken in good faith to implement a defense authorized under this section or otherwise to restrict or prevent the transmission of, or access to, a communication specified in this section.\n  (2) No State or local government may impose any liability for commercial activities or actions by commercial entities, nonprofit libraries, or institutions of higher education in connection with an activity or action described in subsection (a)(2) or (d) that is inconsistent with the treatment of those activities or actions under this section: Provided, however, That nothing herein shall preclude any State or local government from enacting and enforcing complementary oversight, liability, and regulatory systems, procedures, and requirements, so long as such systems, procedures, and requirements govern only intrastate services and do not result in the imposition of inconsistent rights, duties or obligations on the provision of interstate services. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude any State or local government from governing conduct not covered by this section.\n(g) Application and enforcement of other Federal law. Nothing in subsection (a), (d), (e), or (f) or in the defenses to prosecution under subsection (a) or (d) shall be construed to affect or limit the application or enforcement of any other Federal law.\n(h) Definitions.

Traditional Indian religious use of peyote.\n(a) Congressional findings and declarations. The Congress finds and declares that\u2014\n  (1) for many Indian people, the traditional ceremonial use of the peyote cactus as a religious sacrament has for centuries been integral to a way of life, and significant in perpetuating Indian tribes and cultures;\n  (2) since 1965, this ceremonial use of peyote by Indians has been protected by Federal regulation;\n  (3) while at least 28 States have enacted laws which are similar to, or are in conformance with, the Federal regulation which protects the ceremonial use of peyote by Indian religious practitioners, 22 States have not done so, and this lack of uniformity has created hardship for Indian people who participate in such religious ceremonies;\n  (4) the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), held that the First Amendment does not protect Indian practitioners who use peyote in Indian religious ceremonies, and also raised uncertainty whether this religious practice would be protected under the compelling State interest standard; and\n  (5) the lack of adequate and clear legal protection for the religious use of peyote by Indians may serve to stigmatize and marginalize Indian tribes and cultures, and increase the risk that they will be exposed to discriminatory treatment.\n(b) Use, possession, or transportation of peyote.\n  (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the use, possession, or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide traditional ceremonial purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited by the United States or any State. No Indian shall be penalized or discriminated against on the basis of such use, possession or transportation, including, but not limited to, denial of otherwise applicable benefits under public assistance programs.\n  (2) This section does not prohibit such reasonable regulation and registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration of those persons who cultivate, harvest, or distribute peyote as may be consistent with the purposes of this section and section 1996 of this title.\n  (3) This section does not prohibit application of the provisions of section 481.111(a) of Vernon\u2019s Texas Health and Safety Code Annotated, in effect on October 6, 1994, insofar as those provisions pertain to the cultivation, harvest, and distribution of peyote.\n  (4) Nothing in this section shall prohibit any Federal department or agency, in carrying out its statutory responsibilities and functions, from promulgating regulations establishing reasonable limitations on the use or ingestion of peyote prior to or during the performance of duties by sworn law enforcement officers or personnel directly involved in public transportation or any other safety-sensitive positions where the performance of such duties may be adversely affected by such use or ingestion. Such regulations shall be adopted only after consultation with representatives of traditional Indian religions for which the sacramental use of peyote is integral to their practice. Any regulation promulgated pursuant to this section shall be subject to the balancing test set forth in section 3 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103\u2013141; 42 U.S.C. 2000bb\u20131).\n  (5) This section shall not be construed as requiring prison authorities to permit, nor shall it be construed to prohibit prison authorities from permitting, access to peyote by Indians while incarcerated within Federal or State prison facilities.\n  (6) Subject to the provisions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103\u2013141; 42 U.S.C. 2000bb\u20131) [ 42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.], this section shall not be construed to prohibit States from enacting or enforcing reasonable traffic safety laws or regulations.\n  (7) Subject to the provisions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103\u2013141; 42 U.S.C. 2000bb\u20131), this section does not prohibit the Secretary of Defense from promulgating regulations establishing reasonable limitations on the use, possession, transportation, or distribution of peyote to promote military readiness, safety, or compliance with international law or laws of other countries. Such regulations shall be adopted only after consultation with representatives of traditional Indian religions for which the sacramental use of peyote is integral to their practice.\n(c) Definitions. For purposes of this section\u2014\n  (1) the term \u201cIndian\u201d means a member of an Indian tribe;\n  (2) the term \u201cIndian tribe\u201d means any tribe, band, nation, pueblo, or other organized group or community of Indians, including any Alaska Native village (as defined in, or established pursuant to, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)), which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians;\n  (3) the term \u201cIndian religion\u201d means any religion\u2014\n    (A) which is practiced by Indians, and\n    (B) the origin and interpretation of which is from within a traditional Indian culture or community; and\n  (4) the term \u201cState\u201d means any State of the United States, and any political subdivision thereof.\n(d) Protection of rights of Indians and Indian tribes.

The Commission shall issue its determination not later than 120 days after the request from the Trade Representative is made.\n  (5) Consultations on implementation of Commission determination. The Trade Representative shall consult with the congressional committees before the Commission\u2019s determination under paragraph (4) is implemented.\n  (6) Revocation of order. If, by virtue of the Commission\u2019s determination under paragraph (4), an antidumping or countervailing duty order with respect to some or all of the imports that are subject to the action of the Commission described in paragraph (1) is no longer supported by an affirmative Commission determination under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.] or this subsection, the Trade Representative may, after consulting with the congressional committees under paragraph (5), direct the administering authority to revoke the antidumping or countervailing duty order in whole or in part.\n(b) Action by administering authority.\n  (1) Consultations with administering authority and congressional committees.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1202 et seq.], the administering authority shall, within 180 days after receipt of a written request from the Trade Representative, issue a determination in connection with the particular proceeding that would render the administering authority\u2019s action described in paragraph (1) not inconsistent with the findings of the panel or the Appellate Body.\n  (3) Consultations before implementation. Before the administering authority implements any determination under paragraph (2), the Trade Representative shall consult with the administering authority and the congressional committees with respect to such determination.\n  (4) Implementation of determination.
